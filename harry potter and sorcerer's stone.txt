EXT. PRIVET DRIVE - NIGHT
Dark at this hour, except for the STREET LAMPS that dot the street, spilling deep pools of light upon the ground.
On the far corner, a MAN MATERIALIZES out of the darkness. He is tall and thin, with a silver beard long enough to tuck into his belt. He wears a PURPLE CLOAK and is roughly one hundred and fifty years old. He is ALBUS DUMBLEDORE.
Dumbledore removes a small silver object from his cloak—the PUT-OUTER. He extends his hand and—CLICK—the nearest street lamp GOES OUT with a soft pop. He continues to click the Put-Outer until all the lamps go DARK.
He turns, spies a CAT, sitting on the wall of Number Four. He smiles knowingly.
DUMBLEDORE
I should have known you'd be here, Professor McGonagall.
The cat leaps forward, TRANSFIGURES itself into a rather severe-looking woman in an EMERALD CLOAK.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
Are the rumors true, Albus?
DUMBLEDORE
smile fading
I'm afraid so. The good. And the bad.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
And the boy?
DUMBLEDORE
Hagrid's bringing him.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
You think it...wise...to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?
DUMBLEDORE
I would trust Hagrid with my life, Professor.
A LOW RUMBLE disturbs the skies. Dumbledore and McGonagall look up and—suddenly—a HUGE MOTORCYCLE plummets through the clouds, hits the ground with a THUNDEROUS ROAR. As the SMOKE clears, a FIGURE climbs off. He is HAGRID and is, quite obviously, a GIANT. In his vast, muscular arms, he holds a BUNDLE of BLANKETS.
HAGRID
Ev'ning, professor Dumbledore, sir. Professor McGonagall.
DUMBLEDORE
No problems, I take it, Hagrid?
HAGRID
No sir. Little tyke fell ter sleep as we was flyin' o'er Bristol.
Hagrid steps forward and Dumbledore takes the bundle, turns toward the doorstep.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
Albus, do you really think it best to leave him here, with these people? I've been watching them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They're...
DUMBLEDORE
The only family he has.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
But this boy will be famous. There won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name...
DUMBLEDORE
Exactly. It would be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous before he can walk and talk. Famous for something he won't even remember. No. He'll be much better off growing up away from all that. Until he's ready.
Dumbledore lays the bundle on the mat. Hagrid SNIFFLES.
DUMBLEDORE
There, there, Hagrid. It's not eally goodbye, after all.
Hagrid hods. Dumbledore tucks a PARCHMENT ENVELOPE into the blankets and steps back, his face suddenly dark. Serious.
DUMBLEDORE
Good luck, Harry Potter.
The CAMERA DOLLIES forward, toward the swaddled baby. A CUT, still fresh, gleams on the baby's forehead. It is in the shape of a BOLT of LIGHTNING. SMASH CUT TO TEN YEARS LATER.
INT. CUPBOARD - NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - MORNING
A pair of blinking GREEN EYES jerk into the light.
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Up! Now!
THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!
WOMAN'S VOICE
I said now!
FOOTSTEPS RECEDE and HARRY POTTER, now ten years old, swings his skinny legs to the floor. He's small, which is lucky since his room is not really a room at all, but merely a cupboard under the stairs.
Abruptly, the cupboard begins to SHAKE, DUST spilling from the joists above Harry's head. Calmly, Harry takes a pair of EYEGLASSES—taped at the bridge with Sellotape—from a nail.
EXT. HALLWAY - DAY
Harry comes blinking out the cupboard door, watches his enormous cousin, DUDLEY, thunder down the last step. Just then, Harry's Aunt Petunia appears in the kitchen ahead.
AUNT PETUNIA
There's the birthday boy! Don't you look smart for your trip to the zoo.
scowling at Harry
You mind the bacon. And don't dare let it burn. I want everything perfect on my Dimplin's special day.
HARRY
Yes, Aunt Petunia.
INT. KITCHEN - DAY
Harry enters, finds his UNCLE VERNON reading the Daily Mail behind a monstrous PILE OF PRESENTS.
UNCLE VERNON
Bring my coffee, boy.
HARRY
Yes, Uncle Vernon.
Dudley enters, stares at the presents.
DUDLEY
How many are there?
UNCLE VERNON
Thirty-six. Counted them myself.
DUDLEY
Thirty-six. But last year...last year I had thirty-seven...
UNCLE VERNON
Well now, son, some of these are quite a bit bigger than last year--
DUDLEY
I DON'T CARE HOW BIG THEY ARE!
AUNT PETUNIA
Now, now, here's what we'll do. Today, when we're out, we'll buy you two more presents. How's that, popkin?
DUDLEY
So then I'll have...I'll have...
HARRY
Thirty-eight, popkin.
Aunt Petunia cuffs Harry on the head on her way to the RINGING TELEPHONE.
AUNT PETUNIA
You just mind that bacon!
HARRY
Yes, Aunt Petunia.
As Dudley tears open a BOX of LEAD SOLDIERS, Uncle Vernon ruffles his hair.
UNCLE VERNON
Want your money's worth, don't you, tiger. Well, look there. Aunt Marge's sent you the Fourth Battalion?
Dudley twists the head off one.
DUDLEY
This one's lost its head.
UNCLE VERNON
Well now, son. Remember, we talked about this. They're not meant to move...
As Dudleyrtosses the damaged soldier aside, Harry studies it closely, then...Aunt Petunia HANGS UP the phone, turns.
AUNT PETUNIA
Bad news. Mrs. Figgs' broken her leg. She can't take him.
UNCLE VERNON
We could phone Yvonne.
AUNT PETUNIA
Don't be silly. She hates the boy.
HARRY
You could just leave me here.
UNCLE VERNON
And come back to find the house in ruins?
DUDLEY
I...Don't...Want...Him...To...Come! He... always... spoils... everything!
AUNT PETUNIA
Now, precious, don't cry. He won't spoil anything. What if Mummy buys you three more presents.
DUDLEY
Three?
AUNT PETUNIA
As many as you want, sweetums.
As Aunt Petunia cuddles him, Dudley shoots Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother's arms.
EXT. NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - A BIT LATER
As Harry gets in the car, Uncle Vernon leans close.
UNCLE VERNON
I'm warning you now, boy. Any funny business, any at all, and you'll have no meals for a week...
EXT. ZOO - DAY
Happy children walk hand in hand with their parents, as...
INT. REPTILE HOUSE - LATER - DAY
Dudley presses his pudgy nose to a gleaming plate of glass.
DUDLEY
Make it move.
Uncle Vernon looks over a zoo map at the HUGE BURMESE PYTHON curled beyond the glass. RAPS his knuckles. Nothing.
HARRY
He's asleep.
DUDLEY
He's boring.
Dudley waddles away and the others follow, all but Harry, who steps forward and rubs Dudley's noseprint from the glass.
HARRY
Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, watching people press their ugly faces in on you...
The snake nods. Harry stops, looks off, then back. WHISPERS:
HARRY
Can you hear me?
The snake cocks its head and...winks.
HARRY
It's just, I've never talked to a snake before. Do you, I mean...do you talk to people often?
The snake regards Harry...then slowly shakes its head no. Harry nods, looking a bit unnerved.
HARRY
So...you're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there? Do you miss your family?
listening
I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents either...
DUDLEY
MUMMY! DAD! COME HERE! You won't believe what this snake is doing!
Dudley JABS Harry hard in the ribs, sending him tumbling to the concrete, floor. Angry, Harry looks up as Dudley leans against the^glass and it...VANISHES. Dudley flops forward, the snake slithers out, and people run screaming.
Stunned, Harry watches the python slip into the sunshine, then glances back to the snake tank. The glass has reappeared and Dudley sits within, face pale, eyes frozen in terror.
INT. NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - LATER - DAY
Uncle Vernon, face purple with rage, drags Harry by the ear.
HARRY
I swear, I don't know how it happened! One minute the glass was there and then it was gone. It was like magic.
Uncle Vernon hurls Harry into the cupboard, stares hard.
UNCLE VERNON
There's...no...such...thing...as...magic!
The door SLAMS. Harry sits quietly. Then, from his pocket, he removes the damaged soldier Dudley had discarded earlier.
Reaching up, he places it on a dark shelf, next to half a dozen others.
EXT. NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - MORNING
A single OWL swoops down onto the Dursley's roof.
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
Dudley parades about the kitchen in knickerbockers, tailcoat and straw boater, tapping the floor with a KNOBBLY STICK, while a teary Aunt Petunia snaps a photo with a FLASH CAMERA.
AUNT PETUNIA
Oh, Vernon, look at him. To think in only a week he'll be off to Smeltings.
UNCLE VERNON
Proudest moment of my life.
HARRY
with dread
Will I have to wear that too?
AUNT PETUNIA
You! Go to Smeltings? Don't be stupid. You'll goto state school, where you belong. That there'll be yours, once I'm done dying it.
Harry glances at a tub of grey mud boiling on the stove.
HARRY
But that's Dudley's old uniform. It'll fit me like bits of old elephant skin.
AUNT PETUNIA
Fit you fine enough. Now fetch the post.
INT. FRONT HALL - DAY
Three letters lie on the mat. A bill. A postcard. An envelope of YELLOW PARCHMENT. Harry takes all, then stops, staring at the envelope, which is addressed in EMERALD INK.
Mr. H. Potter
The Cupboard Under The Stairs
4 Privet Drive
Little Whinging
Surrey
Harry turns the envelope over, finds a PURPLE WAX SEAL. It is a COAT OF ARMS, surrounding a large letter H.
INT. KITCHEN - DAY
arry drops the post on the table and sits, staring in quiet wonderment at his envelope. Uncle Vernon takes the postcard.
UNCLE VERNON
Marge's ill. Ate a funny whelk...
BAM! Dudley brings the Smelting stick down-hard on the table.
DUDLEY
Dad! Look! Harry's got a letter!
Quickly, Uncle Vernon SNATCHES it away.
HARRY
That's mine!
UNCLE VERNON
Yours. Who'd be writing to you—
Uncle Vernon's face goes pale.
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
The boys come flying into the hall, throw themselves against the door as.it slams shut.
HARRY
I want my letter!
DUDLEY
I want my stick!
Harry and Dudley make a furious play for the keyhole, but Dudley's size proves too much and Harry, glasses dangling from one ear, settles for the crack between door and floor.
HARRY'S POV
of Uncle Vernon's thick black shoes pacing back and forth.
AUNT PETUNIA
Vernon. Look at the address. How could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don't think they're watching the house?
UNCLE VERNON
Watching. Spying. Following us. We both know the dangerous nonsense your sister and her husband were mixed up in.
AUNT PETUNIA
But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back. Tell them we don't want—
UNCLE VERNON
No. We'll ignore it. If they don't get an answer...Yes, that's best...I'll burn it.
HARRY
NO! I WANT MY LETTER!
INT. KITCHEN - DAY
Uncle Vernon walks to the stove, flips on a gas jet. As the letter BURNS, Harry POUNDS the door, and a MONTAGE BEGINS.
EXT. ROOF - NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - MORNING
An OWL beats its way across the sky, flutters down upon the TV ANTENNA, where TWO OTHER OWLS already sit.
INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
A frowning? Uncle Vernon stands before the TELLY, struggling to unscramble a RUGBY MATCH. The CLICK of the MAIL SLOT is heard and he turns.
INT. FRONT HALL -DAY
THREE MORE LETTERS lie on the mat. Uncle Vernon enters, snatches them up, RIPS them to pieces.
INT. CUPBOARD - DAY
Harry sits sadly upon his bed, when...BANG! BANG! BANG!
INT. FRONT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Harry eases open the cupboard door. Down the hallway, Uncle Vernon stands swinging a hammer, mouth bulging with nails as he POUNDS SHUT the mail slot.
EXT. NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - MORNING
Uncle Vernon exits the house with his briefcase, stops. FOUR OWLS sit atop his Vauxhall. He watches curiously as they take flight, then looks down. FOUR LETTERS lie at his feet.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
The FIREPLACE BLAZES. Uncle Vernon pitches a handful of LETTERS into the flames, turns. Harry stands watching.
EXT. ROOF - NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - SAME TIME
As the CHIMNEY SMOKES, FIVE OWLS sit in black silhouette against a full moon.
EXT. KITCHEN WINDOW - NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - MORNING
Aunt Petunia cracks an EGG. Inside is a LETTER. She cracks another. Another LETTER. We PAN off the window to Dudley's neglected BICYCLE. Perched atop the handlebars, seat and tires are SIX OWLS. MONTAGE ENDS.
INT. LIVING ROOM - SUNDAY MORNING - DAY
Dudley lies on the floor, destroying another birthday toy, as Aunt Petunia carefully sets a cup of coffee by Uncle Vernon, who sits in an armchair, smiling strangely.
UNCLE VERNON
Fine day, Sunday. Best day of the week in my opinion. Know why I say that, Dudley?
HARRY
entering
Because there's no post on Sundays.
Uncle Vernon looks up brightly, but Harry's eyes are on the window behind him. Outside, the sky is DARK WITH OWLS.
UNCLE VERNON
Right you are, Harry! No damn letters today! No sir. Not one blasted...
Just then, something WHIZZES DOWN the chimney and SMACKS Uncle Vernon flat on the back of the head. Seconds later another follows, and then another, until the living room is aflock with...LETTERS. Harry leaps onto a table, trying to snag one, when Uncle Vernon seizes him by the waist.
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
As Uncle Vernon stumbles out, Harry shakes free of his grasp and stares dumbly: LETTERS swirl up and down the hall.
DUDLEY
Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly!
A letter flutters on Harry's fingertips...before Uncle Vernon sweeps it away, eyes crazed, SHOUTING CRAZILY:
UNCLE VERNON
That does it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us! Where they can't get to us!
Dudley glances at his mother.
DUDLEY
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?
EXT. HUT ON THE ROCK - NIGHT
A very sad-looking HUT sits perched upon a large ROCK far at sea. Wind whistles. The sea rages.
INT. HUT ON THE ROCK - NIGHT
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia sleep on a lumpy bed in the hut's only bedroom. Dudley SNORES on a moth-eaten sofa. Harry lies on the bare floor beneath a ragged blanket. LIGHTNING FLASHES. As the room goes dark again, Harry studies the lighted dial of Dudley's watch. As it ticks toward midnight, Harry puts the last touches to a BIRTHDAY CAKE he's etched in the dust that layers the floor.
HARRY
Make a wish, Harry.
Closing his eyes, he...blows...and the "flames" of dust scatter. Eyes still closed, Harry holds the wish when...
BOOM!
The DOOR SHUDDERS. HINGES squeal. A pin squirrels out of its housing. Falls to the floor.
BOOM!
Uncle Vernon comes sledding into the room in his socks, a RIFLE in hand, paper hanging by a string from the barrel.
UNCLE VERNON
Who's there? I warn you--I'm armed!
SMASH! The door falls flat. An IMMENSE SILHOUETTE stands against the raging sea outside, identical to the beastly figure seen climbing the stairs in Godric's Hollow. He is HAGRID and is, rather obviously, a GIANT. Presently he is standing on the front door.
HAGRID
Er, right. Sorry 'bout that...
Hagrid steps clear, takes the door, and fits it back into its frame. Glances at Dudley. Frowns.
HAGRID
Mind, I haven't seen yeh since you was a baby, Harry, but yeh're a bit more along than I woulda expected. ’Specially round the middle.
DUDLEY
terrified
I'm not Harry.
HARRY
I am.
Hagrid turns, watches Harty's face come into the light.
HAGRID
Well now, course yeh are.
UNCLE VERNON
I demand that you leave at once, sir! You are breaking and entering!
HAGRID
Ah, dry up, Dursley, yeh great prune.
Hagrid takes the rifle, knots it like a piece of licorice.
HAGRID
Anyway, Harry. Got summat fer yeh. ’Fraid I mighta sat on it at some point, but ’magine it'll taste all right jus' the same...let's see now...got it here somewhere...
Hagrid rummages in his coat, removes: a kettle, frying pan, sausages, one PINK UMBRELLA and, finally, a squashed paper box containing a CHOCOLATE CAKE with "Happee Birthdae, Harry" scrawled in green icing.
HAGRID
Baked it meself, words an' all.
HARRY
Thank you.
HAGRID
Well, it's not ev' ry day yer young mein turns ’leven.
Hagrid turns to the fireplace, gives the embers a poke with the pink umbrella. As they ROAR to life, he takes the frying pan, lobs in the sausages. Dudley perks up as they sizzle.
HARRY
Excuse me, but.. .who are you?
Harry stares blankly. Hagrid frowns.
HAGRID
Blimey, Harry, did yeh never wonder where yer parents learnt it all?
HARRY
Learned what?
HAGRID
What? DURSLEY!!! Do yeh mean ter tell me the boy knows nothin?
Uncle Vernon stands mute. Hagrid simmers, then shakes his head and turns back to the fire.
HAGRID
’Harry, yer a wizard.
For a moment, the hut is utterly silent.
HARRY
I'm a what?
HAGRID
A Wizard. And a thumpin' good 'un, I'd wager, once yeh've been trained up a bit.
HARRY
No. You've made a mistake. I...I can't be a...wizard. I mean...I'm just...Harry. Just Harry.
HAGRID
Tha' right. Tell me, Harry. Ever make somethin' strange 'appen? When yeh was scared maybe. Or angry?
As Harry looks up in recognition, Hagrid slaps a soggy ENVELOPE into Harry's hand. Harry opens it, reads.
HARRY
'Dear Mr. Potter, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry...'
As Harry looks up, Hagrid winks, and takes a bite of sausage.
UNCLE VERNON
He'll not be going, I tell you! We swore when we took him in we'd put a stop to that rubbish!
HARRY
You knew? You knew I'm a...a wizard?
Aunt Petunia—looking furious—emerges from the shadows.
AUNT PETUNIA
Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, mother and father were so proud when the letter came. A witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful. I was the only one who saw her for what she was...a freak!
distastefully
Then she met that Potter and had you. I knew you'd be the same. Just as strange, just as abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you—
HARRY
Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash.
HAGRID
CAR CRASH! A car crash kill Lily and James Potter? It's an outrage! A scandal!
UNCLE VERNON
HE'LL NOT BE GOING, I TELL YOU!
HAGRID
An' I s'ppose a great Muggle like yerself is goin' ter stop him.
HARRY
Muggle?
HAGRID
Non-magic folk.
turning to Uncle Vernon
This boy's name's been down ever since he was born. He's off to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world and he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwart's has ever known, Albus Dumbledore—
UNCLE VERNON
I will not pay for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!
Hagrid spins, eyes bulging.
HAGRID
NEVER..INSULT...ALBUS...DUMBLEDORE...IN...FRONT...OF..ME!
Hagrid spins, points the umbrella at Uncle Vernon, then spies Dudley, one hand deep in Harry's birthday cake. POP!—a FLASH of VIOLET LIGHT hits Dudley square in the rump. Instantly, a PIG’S TAIL curls through the back of his trousers. Uncle Vernon ROARS, hurries everyone out of the room.
HAGRID
Tha’s curious. Meant ter turn ’im into a complete pig, whole hog an all. Suppose he was so much like a pig already, there wasn't much left ter do.
Hagrid sees Harry staring in awe at the pink umbrella.
HAGRID
Er, be grateful if yeh didn't mention that to anyone at Hogwarts. Strictly speakin', I'm not allowed ter do magic.
checks pocket watch
Bit behind schedule, aren't we? Best be off.
Hagrid exits, leaving Harry to consider his sorry surroundings. He looks momentarily at a loss, then...Hagrid pokes his head back in.
HAGRID
T'Less, o' course, yeh'd rather stay.
EXT. STREET - LONDON - DAWN
Harry, reads ALOUD from his LIST as he trails Hagrid, who draws an eye or two—as a giant in Central London will.
HARRY
'First year students will require three sets of plain work robes, one plain pointed hat for day wear, one pair of dragon-hide gloves...'
Hagrid chuckles at a PARKING METER.
HAGRID
Things these Muggles dream up...
INT. TRAIN - LONDON - DAWN
Harry sits beside Hagrid, continues to read from his list.
HARRY
'...and the following Set Books: The Standard Book of Spells by Miranda Goshawk. One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore...'
EXT. STREET/LEAKY CAULDRON - LONDON - DAWN
Hagrid leads Harry on, parting the crowd easily.
HARRY
'One wand, one standard Size 2 pewter cauldron and may bring, if they desire, either an owl, a cat, or a toad.'
looking up
Can we find all this in London?
Hagrid pauses by a NARROW GRAY DOOR that stands between a BOOK SHOP on one side and a RECORD SHOP on the other.
HAGRID
If yen know where to go.
INT. LEAKY CAULDRON - DAY
A dark, shabby pub. in a corner, some OLD WOMEN sit drinking, one smoking a pipe as long as her arm. Up front, a TINY MAN in a TOP HAT talks to the BARTENDER, who resembles a gummy walnut. Harry and Hagrid enter.
BARTENDER
Hagrid! The usual, I presume—
spying Harry
Good Lord. Is this? Can this be him? Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter.
The pub goes quiet. Then... everyone is up and around Harry, holding out their hands and gabbling, while Hagrid looks on, beaming. Slowly, a NERVOUS YOUNG MAN makes his way forward.
QUIRRELL
Harry P-P-Potter. C-Can't tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.
HAGRID
Professor! Didn't see yeh there. Harry, this 'ere's Professor Quirrell. He'll be yer Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.
QUIRRELL
F-F-Fearfully f-fascinating subject. N-Not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?
Quirrell's eyes flutter nervously over Harry's scar.
HAGRID
Yes, well, must get on. Lots ter buy.
as he pulls Harry along
See? Tol' yeh you was famous.
EXT. BACK COURTYARD/LEAKY CAULDRON - MOMENTS LATER
Hagrid TAPS the bricks of one wall with the tip of his umbrella while Harry stands by, deep in thought.
HARRY
Why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there. How is it they know who I am?
HAGRID
Don' know that I'm the right one ter tell yeh that, Harry. Let's see now...Three up...Two across...Right. Stand back now.
Hagrid gives the wall one last 'TAP and the bricks QUIVER, wriggling and jiggling until an ARCHWAY appears, giving out on a COBBLED STREET so long and twisting it seems never to end. As Harry's jaw drops, Hagrid grins.
HAGRID
Welcome, Harry. To Diagon Alley.
EXT. DIAGON ALLEY - CONTINUOUS - MORNING
As Harry steps through, the archway SHRINKS INSTANTLY into a solid wall. All around him, Harry sees mothers and fathers with children in tow, clutching LISTS similar to his own.
PLUMP WOMAN
Seventeen Sickles an ounce for Dragon Liver, can you imagine? They're mad!
MOTHER
It says brass, Trevor. As such, you will get brass,
BOY
There it is! The Nimbus Two Thousand! Runs a good twenty times faster than the old Comets. Neil Marks himself rides it for the Chudley Cannons.
FATHER
Mind you don't drop your bottle of eel's eye, Belinda, I'll not buy you another.
Harry tries to take in everything at once, marveling at shops specializing in everything from cauldrons, owls and broomsticks to robes, 'unmentionables,' and spell books.
HARRY
Dragon Liver? Do they mean from a real dragon?
HAGRID
Well, they don't mean a ruddy penguin. Crikey, I'd like a dragon.
HARRY
You'd like a dragon?
HAGRID
Vastly misunderstood beasts, Harry. Vastly misunderstood...
HARRY
staring in a cauldron shop
But how am I to pay for all this, Hagrid? I haven't any money.
Hagrid gestures to a TOWERING, SNOW-WHITE BUILDING ahead.
HAGRID
There's yer money. Gringotts. Wizard's Bank. No place safer, Harry. Not one. 'Cept perhaps Hogwarts.
INT. GRINGOTTS - DAY
ONE HUNDRED GOBLINS sit on high stools at a long counter, scribbling in ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales. As Harry and Hagrid enter, a clever-looking goblin closes the door behind them, watches their every step.
HARRY
Uh, Hagrid, what exactly was that?
HAGRID
Yer basic Door Goblin. Clever as they come goblins, but not yer most friendly beasts. Best stay close.
stepping up to a teller
Mornin'. Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal.
GOBLIN
And Mr. Harry Potter has his key?
HAGRID
Let's see, got it 'ere somewhere...
The Goblin looks on disfavorably as Hagrid rifles his coat, producing in rapid succession: a jangly RING of KEYS, one BALL of STRING, a fistful of MINT HUMBUGS, two TEABAGS, and a MOTH...which simply flutters from one pocket to another.
HAGRID
Ah, 'ere's the li'l devil.
leaning close
There's another matter as well. I've got a letter from Professor Dumbledore. It's about the You-Know-What in Vault You-Know-Which.
GOBLIN
Very well. I'll have Griphook take you.
INT. STONE PASSAGEWAY - GRINGOTTS - DAY
CLOSE ON: GRIPHOOK
...a swarthy, slit-eyed goblin, driving a small cart with white-knuckle precision down a STONE PASSAGEWAY lit with FLAMING TORCHES. They plunge deeper, come...
EXT. VAULT - STONE PASSAGEWAY - DAY
...whistling to a halt before a SMALL DOOR. Griphook steps out, takes Harry's key and UNLOCKS the vault, revealing - great glittering pyramids of coin. Harry is speechless.
HAGRID
Din' think yer parents would leave yeh with nothin', did yeh?
INT. CART - PASSAGEWAYS - A FEW MINUTES LATER
The cart hurtles even DEEPER, abruptly stops.
GRIPHOOK
Vault Seven Hundred Thirteen.
HARRY
What's in here, Hagrid?
HAGRID
Can’t tell yeh that, Harry. Hogwarts business. Very secret.
Griphook steps up to a door with no keyhole, strokes it with one long finger, and it simply MELTS away.
HAGRID
Anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through the door.
HARRY
How often do you check to see if anyone's inside?
GRIPHOOK
About once every ten years.
Harry peers into the vault, sees...a GRUBBY LITTLE PACKAGE. Hagrid slips it into his LEFT COAT POCKET, returns.
HAGRID
Best not mention this ter anyone either, Harry.
EXT. DIAGON ALLEY - LATER - DAY
Harry and Hagrid exit the Apothecary, loaded with Harry's various purchases. Harry studies the list in his hand.
HARRY
I still need...a wand.
HAGRID
points ahead
Only place for wands, is Ollivanders. You go inside. I got one more thing I gotta'do.
Harry nods, walks into Ollivanders.
INT. OLLIVANDERS WAND SHOP - DAY
Harry and Hagrid stand in a very narrow shop where thousands of slender boxes are stacked to the ceiling. Hovering above them on a spindly ladder is a pale old man with eyes like silver moons. He is OLLIVANDER.
OLLIVANDER
I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. Seems only yesterday your mother and father we're in here buying their first wands...
Ollivander steps down.with a pair of slender boxes.
OLLIVANDER
extending a box
Here we are. Just give it a wave.
Feeling a bit supid, Harry raises his arm. Nothing.
OLLIVANDER
No. Apparently not. Perhaps this.
Harry raises it and...BRIGHT LIGHT shoots forth...sending a CRYSTAL VASE OF BLACK ROSES shattering to the floor.
OLLIVANDER
No. No. Definitely not. No Matter. After all...it's the wand that chooses the wizard.
INT. OLLIVANDERS WAND SHOP - LATER
HUNDREDS OF WAND BOXES lie at Harry's feet. Hagrid, eyes heavy, sits on a spindly chair. Ollivander, meanwhile, stands at the top of a spindly ladder, eyeing his inventory.
OLLIVANDER
I wonder...
Ollivander descends, presents a box. Stifling a yawn, Harry takes the wand...and his expression changes.
OLLIVANDER
Go on then.
As Harry extends his arm his hand trembles. A breeze stirs, sending the shop's tiny bell RINGING. The pages of a BOOK FLUTTER on the counter, and Harry's hair feathers off his forehead, showing his scar. Astounded, Harry smiles and then.. .Ollivander slips the wand from his fingers and the breeze dies, the shop returning to its eerie calm.
OLLIVANDER.
Curious. Very curious...
HARRY
Sorry, but what's curious?
OLLIVANDER
I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather resides in your wand, gave another feather. Just one other. It's curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother...
eyes shifting
...gave you that scar.
HARRY
And who owned that wand?
Ollivander exchanges a surprised glance with Hagrid.
HAGRID
We don't speak his name, Harry.
OLLIVANDER
As I said, the wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why. But I think it's clear we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things.
Ollivander slides the lid on the box, hands it to Harry.
OLLIVANDER
Terrible, yes. But great.
Harry looks out the window, sees Hagrid standing there, bolding a cage with a snow white Owl inside. Harry turns to say goodbye to Ollivander. He's gone. Harry runs outside.
EXT. DIAGON ALLEY - DAY
Harry runs up to Hagrid, looks at the owl.
HAGRID
Happy Birthday, Harry.
HARRY
excited
For me?...Really?...He's Mine?...
HAGRID
Crikey, yeh'd think yeh hadn't gotten a birthday present before.
HARRY
I haven't. Not really.
INT. LEAKY CAULDRON
Hagrid and Harry sit at a table in the corner. Hagrid dips a spoon into a huge bowl of soup, looks up.
HAGRID
You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet.
HARRY
touching his scar
He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid. I know you do.
Hagrid studies Harry, conflicted, then sets down his spoon.
HAGRID.
'Course I know. Who do yeh think carried yeh out o' yer parents' house, Hallowe'en night, ten years ago? Who do yeh think brought yeh ter Dumbledore an' watched him lay yeh on yer Aunt an' Uncle's doorstep? 'Course I know, Harry.
Hagrid leans in closer, his eyes glimmering in the dim pub.
HAGRID
Firs', un'erstand this, 'cause it's important: not all yer wizards are good. Some go bad. Years ago, there was this one wizard who went as bad as you could go. His name was...was...
HARRY
Maybe if you wrote it down.
HAGRID
Nah—can' spell it. All right—Voldemort.
HARRY
Voldemort?
Hagrid shivers, holds up his hand, and glances quickly about the shadows of the pub before continuing.
HAGRID
Dark days those were, Harry. Volde...You-Know-Who...started lookin' fer followers. Got 'em too. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Including yer parents. No one lived once he decided to kill 'em. Not one. 'Cept you.
HARRY
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?
HAGRID
That's no ord'nary cut on your forehead. A mark like that only comes when yeh've been touched by a curse. An evil curse.
Just then, a HIGH, CACKLING VOICE pierces the silence. Harry turns, sees an OLD WOMAN laughing with the gummy bartender.
HARRY
But what happened to Vol...to You-Know-Who?
HAGRID
Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. I reckon he's out there somewhere, jus' too weak to carry on. But one thing's fer certain, Harry. Somethin' about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous. That's why e'ryone knows yer name.
Hagrid leans close once more and t-Ms time his voice is barely a WHISPER.
HAGRID
You're the boy who lived.
EXT. KING'S CROSS STATION - DAHN
Harry and Hagrid, laden with a heavy TRUNK and SNOWY OWL, stand outside the station in the shimmering dawn light.
Hagrid checks his WATCH, looks suddenly urgent.
HAGRID
Blimey, look at the time. 'Fraid I 'ave ter be leavin' yeh now, Harry. Dumbledore will be wantin'—
Hagrid pats his LEFT POCKET. Catches himself.
HAGRID
He'll be wantin' ter see me.
handing him a TICKET
That there's yer train. Leaves in about ten minutes time. Jus' make sure yeh stick ter yeh ticket. That's very important, Harry. Stick ter yeh ticket...
HARRY
There must be something wrong, Hagrid. This says Platform Nine and Three Quarters. There's no such thing...
Harry looks up, but Hagrid...is gone.
HARRY
...Is there?
INT. LOWER LEVEL - KING'S CROSS - MOMENTS LATER
Harry dashes through a bustling King's Cross, sledding to a halt in front of a pair of PLATFORM SIGNS. One reads NINE. One reads TEN. Harry turns to a passing STATION OFFICER.
HARRY
Excuse me. Can you tell me where I might find Platform Nine and Three-Quarters.
STATION OFFICER
grumbling off
Think you're funny, do you? Nine and Three-Quarters indeed...
Harry looks about, despairingly, then HEARS...
MRS. WEASLEY (O.S.)
...packed with Muggles, of course.
Harry turns, sees a plump woman (MRS. WEASLEY) hurrying along FOUR RED-HEADED BOYS and their little, red-headed sister (GINNY). The boys all tow trunks identical to Harry's.
MRS. WEASLEY
All right, Percy. You first.
Harry watches the tallest boy walk straight toward a dividing barrier.and...VANISH. Harry squints in confusion. Next, Mrs. Weasley turns to a pair of cheeky twins (FRED and GEORGE).
MRS. WEASLEY
Fred. You next.
FRED
I'm not Fred. I'm George. Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother?
MRS. WEASLEY
Sorry, George.
FRED
Only joking. I am Fred.
Fred dashes off, trailed by George. They too vanish.
HARRY
Excuse me. Could you tell me—
MRS. WEASLEY
How to get onto the platform? Not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well.
Harry looks at the youngest red-haired boy. He is tall, gangly, and presently has a SMUDGE on his nose.
MRS. WEASLEY
"All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between Platforms Nine and Ten. Focus...but don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash into it either. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.
Harry looks. Shrugs. ‘Sprinting at full speed, the barrier coming closer and closer, he shuts his eyes and...
EXT. PLATFORM NINE AND THREE QUARTERS - DAY
...SLEDS onto a platform milling with people. A sign above reads HOGWARTS EXPRESS. Below it sits a SCARLET STEAM ENGINE.. Harry glances behind, sees a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words PLATFORM NINE AND THREE QUARTERS on it. Just beyond, he sees Kings Cross and the world he's left behind.
NEW ANGLE ON PLATFORM
Harry struggles with his heavy trunk as all around him people say goodbye to their families. A round-faced boy (NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM) turns frantically to his GRAN.
NEVILLE
Gran! I've lost my toad again.
GRAN
Oh, Neville. Honestly. Not again...
Further up, a BOY IN DREADLOCKS (LEE JORDAN) holds a BOX.
STUDENT
Go on, Lee. Give us a look.
As Lee lifts the LID, a LONG HAIRY LEG protrudes and students SHRIEK. Unimpressed, one of the twins spots Harry struggling.
GEORGE
Want a hand?
HARRY
Yes, please.
GEORGE
Oy! C'mere, Fred! Take a handle.
EXT. PLATFORM - FURTHER ALONG - SECONDS LATER
Fred and George heave Harry's trunk atop other, similar trunks while Harry sets Hedwig with the owls. Harry wipes his sweaty hair off his brow...revealing his scar.
HARRY
Thanks very much.
GEORGE
Blimey. You're...
FRED
Harry Potter.
HARRY
What? Oh, him. Yes. I mean, I am.
MRS. WEASLEY
Fred! George! Come say goodbye to Ginny.
Mrs. Weasley stands waving, the redheaded girl clinging to her dress. The twins take one last look at Harry, dash off.
INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT/EXT. PLATFORM - DAY
Harry exits the crush of the aisle, enters an empty compartment. Very much alone, he sits, peers out the window as Percy Weasley strides forth in billowing BLACK ROBES.
PERCY
Have to go, Mother. The other Prefects are expecting me up front.
FRED
Mum! Guess who’s on the train? Right now.
FRED/GEORGE
Harry Potter!
GINNY
Oh, Mum, can I go on and see him? Please.
MRS. WEASLEY
Certainly not. The boy isn't something you goggle at in a zoo.
as the WHISTLE BLOWS
All right, on you go, all of you. Ron, what is that on your nose?
She goes for a handkerchief, but Ron spins away. She sighs, calls after the twins.
MRS. WEASLEY
You two watch out for your brother. And behave yourselves this year..If I get one more owl telling me you've blown up a toilet or something--
FRED
Blown up a toilet? We've never blown up a toilet.
GEORGE
Great idea, though, thanks, Mum!
EXT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS - DAY
As the train moves out of the station, Ginny chases after.
Harry watches her from his' window until she drops back. King's Cross, and the life he's known, drift away.
EXT. SCOTLAND - HOGWARTS EXPRESS - DAY
The train whips past fields, small country lanes.
INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY
Harry sits quietly. Then the compartment door slides open. Ron stands there. Seeing Harry, he hesitates.
RON
Mind? Everywhere else is full.
HARRY
Not at all.
RON
I’m Ron, by the way.
HARRY
I heard. I’m Harry.
RON
I...heard.
unable to resist
Is it true? I mean, have you really got the...you know...
Without prompting, Harry lifts his hair.. Shows the scar.
RON
Wicked.
HARRY
Are all your family wizards?
RON
Huh? Oh. I think so. Well, Mum's got a second cousin who's an accountant. But we never talk about him. I heard you went to live with Muggles. What are they like?
HARRY
Horrible. Well, not all of them. Mine are, though. Trade them for three wizard brothers any day.
RON
Five. I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others. But if I do, it's no big deal because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes. Charlie's old wand. Even Scabbers used to be Percy's...
Ron reaches into his pocket, pulls out a fat, gray, seemingly unconscious, RAT (SCABBERS).
RON
Hardly ever wakes up. He's useless basically. Percy got an owl for making Prefect, but Mum and Dad couldn't afford-- I mean, I got Scabbers instead.
Roh looks embarrassed. Just then, a DIMPLED WOMAN pushing a TROLLEY FULL OF SWEETS pops her head in.
DIMPLED WOMAN
Anything off the trolley, dears?
Ron mumbles 'No thanks,' takes out a lumpy sandwich. Harry studies him, then digs into his pockets, heavy with coin.
HARRY
We'll take the lot.
CLOSE UP: TROVE OF TREATS
INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY (LATER)
...spread out on an empty seat. Harry marvels at the strange, wondrous candies before him.
HARRY
'Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans'?
RON
They mean every flavor. There's chocolate, peppermint...but you can also get liver or spinach or tripe. George reckons he had a bogey-flavored one once.
HARRY
These aren't real frogs, are they?
Harry holds up a pack of "CHOCOLATE FROGS"—something is wriggling under the foil—then sees that Ron already has a very realistic leg squirreling out the corner of his mouth.
RON
mumbling
Just a spell. Besides, it's the card you want. Each pack's got a Famous Witch or Wizard. Got about 500 myself. Watch it!
As Harry breaks the foil on his pack, the frog springs into the air and out the open train window.
RON
That's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with.
Harry glances at the card in his hand. On it, there's a MAN with a crooked nose, long silver beard, and half-moon glasses. Underneath is a name: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE.
HARRY
I've gotten Dumbledore!
RON
I've about six of him. Trade you Scabbers though, if you get Agrippa or Ptolemy.
HARRY
reading the back
'Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for his discovery of the 12 uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Approximately one hundred and fifty years old, Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music, tenpin bowling, and...
looking up
One hundred and fifty years old?
RON
Thought he'd be older, did you?
HARRY
No--I--Hey, he's gone.
Harry holds up the cardn-now blank--to Ron, who only shrugs.
RON
Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you?
HARRY
It's just, in the Muggle world, people stay put in photos.
RON
Really? They don't move at all? Weird!
Just then, Scabbers SNORTS, falls back asleep.
RON
Pathetic, isn't it? Fred gave me a spell that's to turn him yellow. Want to see?
Harry nods, eager to see some magic. Ron pulls out a BATTERED WAND--just as the compartment door OPENS and a GIRL with bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth looks in. She is HERMIONE GRANGER and is already wearing her school robes.
HERMIONE
Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville has lost one.
seeing Ron's wand
Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.
She sits down. Ron looks a bit taken aback, but clears his throat nonetheless, poises his wand over Scabbers.
RON
Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.
Scabbers SNORTS, but otherwise remains fat, grey, and asleep.
HERMIONE
Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? I've only tried a few simple ones myself but they've all worked for me. For example...
To Harry's surprise, Hermione takes her wand, points it directly over his brow, then...stops.
HERMIONE
Goodness. You're Harry Potter, aren't you? I know all about you, of course. I was doing a little recreational reading and you're in Modern Magical History, The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the 20th Century.
HARRY
Am I?
HERMIONE
Didn't you know? I'd have found out everything I could if it was me.
raising her wand
Anyway...Oculus Reparo.
instantly, the cracked bridge of Harry's glasses is mended.
HERMIONE
There. That's better, isn't it? I'm Hermione Granger, by the way. And you are...?
Ron is still staring at the glasses, feeling a bit outdone.
RON
Um...Ron Weasley.
HERMIONE
Pleasure. Do either of you know what House you'll be in? I'm hoping for Gryffindor--I hear Dumbledore himself was in it--but I think I might just die if they put me in Slytherin. That was You-Know-Who's House. Anyway, you two had better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon. You've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?
As she exits, Harry and Ron just sit, staring at the door.
EXT. HOGSHEADS STATION - HOGWARTS - NIGHT
As the scarlet engine HISSES to a stop, Harry and the others spill out. Harry's robes shimmer grandly, while Ron's secondhand silks show a bit too much sneaker.
HAGRID
Firs' years! Firs' years over here!
Hagrid gives Harry a wink as he comes loping out of the darkness, swinging a LAMP. Ron, preoccupied with wiping his nose clean on his robes, stops, dumbstruck by Hagrid's size.
EXT. BLACK LAKE - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER
A FLEET of TINY BOATS glides silently over a glassy lake. Harry rides with Ron, Hermione and Neville Longbottom, gazing at the DARK TREES of the FOREST that surrounds them. A GLINT OF SILVER flickers through the black trees, like a dream. Harry watches, transfixed, then...
HAGRID
You there! Don' be trailin' yer fingers in the water. Yeh might find yeh don' get 'em all back.
Harry turns, sees that Hagrid is speaking to a POINTY-FACED BOY (DRACO MALFOY). Malfoy eyes Hagrid darkly, whispers to a PAIR OF THICK-LOOKING BOYS (CRABBE and GOYLE).
Harry peers into the black water, sees his own pale face looking back, then a soft GLITTER of REFLECTED LIGHT dances on the surface. He looks up, watches a magnificent CASTLE drift into view. Hogwarts.
INT. ENTRANCE HALL - HOGWARTS CASTLE - NIGHT
Harry and the others enter a grand entryway lit with flaming torches. PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, a rather severe-looking witch in an emerald cloak, stands before a pair of TOWERING DOORS.
She lifts her chin, surveys the new students.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
Welcome to Hogwarts. In a moment, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates, but before you can take your seats, you must be sorted into your Houses. They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. While here, your House is, in many ways, your family. Your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose points. At the end of the year, the House with the most is awarded the House Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you...
Just then, a rather LARGE TOAD springs forth, CROAKS.
NEVILLE
Trevor!
Neville, blissfully relieved, gathers his toad, then peers up from the hem of Professor McGonagall's robes.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
...will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours. The Sorting Ceremony will begin momentarily.
Professor McGonagall glowers at Neville, then exits. As she goes, there is a BRIEF CLAMOR of SOUND from the students waiting in the Great Hall beyond.
HARRY
How exactly do they sort us?
RON
Some kind of test, I think. Fred says it hurts like hell, but I'm sure he was joking. At least...I think he was.
Just then, Draco Malfoy pushes through the crowd, shadowed by the boys from the boat. Malfoy stares openly at Harry's scar.
MALFOY
It's true then, what they were saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.
Harry's eyes slide, appraise the other two boys.
MALFOY
Oh. This is Crabbe and Goyle. And my name's Malfoy. Draco Malfoy.
Ron COUGHS, masking a snigger. Malfoy's eyes narrow.
MALFOY
Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, freckles, and a hand-me-ddwn robe--you must be a Weasley.
to Harry
You'll soon find out some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.
Malfoy extends his hand, but Harry's gaze remains level.
HARRY
I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks.
Malfoy's eyes glitter with rage. Finally he drops his hand, turns away.
HERMIONE
Well, he's rather disagreeable, isn't he?
Ron and Harry turn, see Hermione. Just then, Professor McGonagall returns.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
We are ready for you.
INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT
Harry and the others file into a strangely splendid place lit by THOUSANDS OF CANDLES FLOATING in midair over four long tables lined with students. Harry looks to the windows below the ceiling, finds glorious stars and an icy blue moon.
HERMIONE
It's not real, the ceiling. It's only bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.
Professor McGonagall sweeps to the front of the room where a WIZARD'S HAT—patched and frayed—sits on a stool.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
Before we begin, Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words.
Harry watches with great interest as the great wizard himself rises from his seat at the High Table.
DUMBLEDORE
Yes, and here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! Thank you!
The Great Hall THUNDERS with APPLAUSE.
HERMIONE
I hear he's a genius.
As the applause subsides, the hat TWITCHES. At the brim, a rip OPENS WIDE, and the hat begins to TALK.
SORTING HAT
Oh, you may not think I'm pretty But don't judge on what you see I'll eat myself if you can find
A smarter hat than me. There's nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can't see So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be....
As the students APPLAUD, the hat takes a bow and Professor McGonagall: steps forward with a ROLL OF PARCHMENT.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
When I call your name, you will come forth, put on the hat and be sorted.
consulting her list
Hermione Granger.
HERMIONE
Oh dear. Here it is, isn't it? The moment. Goodness. What if the hat says nothing and we're all just left standing here forever...
RON
as she goes mumbling off
Mental, that one. I'm telling you.
Both watch Hermione seat herself, lower the Hat.
SORTING HAT
GRYFFINDOR!
Percy pulls out a chair for Hermione at the Gryffindor table.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
Draco Malfoy.
RON
Slytherin.
Draco Malfoy swaggers forth and grips the hat. He's barely touched it to his head, when:
SORTING HAT
SLYTHERIN!
RON
off Harry's amazement
There's not a witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin. Draco's father was one of the first to join You-Know-Who when he got power. And one of the first to come back when he lost it.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
Susan Bones.
As SUSAN BONES dashes up front, Harry glances to the High Table. Dumbledore watches the proceedings placidly, while Professor Quirrell talks to a hook-nosed man with greasy black hair and sallow skin, PROFESSOR SNAPE. Slowly, as if he can feel Harry's gaze, Snape turns, looks straight into Harry's eyes. Instantly, a Sharp, hot PAIN shoots across Harry's scar.
HARRY
Ouch!
RON
Harry? What is it?
HARRY
N-nothing. I'm fine.
SORTING HAT
Hufflepuff!
As Susan Bones runs off...
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
Ronald Weasley.
As Ron steps nervously away, Harry glances back to the High Table. Shape has returned to his conversation.
SORTING HAT
Gryffindor!
Fred and George WHOOP LOUDLY as Ron comes grinning out of the hat, greatly relieved. Harry starts to clap himself when...
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
Harry Potter.
There is an abrupt drop in the CHATTER. As Harry makes his way, he avoids the eyes of the many who stare and whisper.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
If you will, Mr. Potter.
Harry sits, takes the hat, and...slowly...lowers it. He waits, then the hat begins to SPEAK.
SORTING HAT
Hmmm. Difficult. Very Difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, oh yes, and a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you...?
Harry grips the edge of the stool, closes his eyes. His lips move ever so slightly: Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.
SORTING HAT
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that... No? Well, if you're sure better be GRYFFINDOR!
A ROAR erupts from the Gryffindor table. Harry stands shakily and walks to his table, where Percy, the Weasley twins, and Hermione all welcome him. At the High Table, Dumbledore lifts his goblet and, meeting Harry's eyes...nods.
INT. GREAT HALL - LATER
Freshly sorted and seated, the Gryffindor first years watch in amazement as the empty plates before them suddenly...fill with food. There is roast beef, chicken, pork chops, lamb chops, sausages, bacon, steak—the feast of all feasts. Harry listens as a rather wild-looking boy named SEAMUS talks to another student, DEAN THOMAS.
SEAMUS
I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle, Mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.
As Percy leans over to pour a strange liquid into Harry's goblet, Harry nods to the High Table, to Professor Snape.
HARRY
Say, Percy. Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?
PERCY
Hm? Oh. Professor Snape. Head of Slytherin House.
HARRY
What's he teach?
PERCY
Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. Been after Quirrell's job for years.
Just then, several STUDENTS SHRIEK as a volley of GHOSTS stream into the hall overhead. One swoops down.
PERCY
Hello, Sir Nicolas. Have a nice summer?
NEARLY HEADLESS NICK
Dismal. What with the Slytherins winning the House Cup six years in a row, the Bloody Baron's become unbearable.
Nick nods his head in the direction of the Slytherin table, where a horrific, BLOOD-STAINED GHOST hovers imperiously.
NEARLY HEADLESS NICK
Then again, he's always been unbearable.
RON
I know you. You're Nearly Headless Nick.
NEARLY HEADLESS NICK
I prefer Sir Nicolas, if you don't mind.
HERMIONE
Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?
NEARLY HEADLESS NICK
Like this.
Seizing himself by the left ear, Nick swings his ENTIRE HEAD off his neck and onto his shoulder, as if it were on a hinge.
NEVILLE
blanching
I think I'm done eating.
Just then, Dumbledore rises at the High Table.
DUMBLEDORE
If I may, I have a few start-of-term notices to announce. First Years should note that the. Dark Forest is strictly forbidden to all pupils. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch has asked me to remind you that...
FILCH, a sour-looking man, stands near a side exit while MRS. NORRIS, a cat with glittering RED EYES, sits by his feet.
DUMBLEDORE
...no magic should be used between classes in the corridors. And finally, please note that this year, the third floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death.
Hearing this, Ron stops chewing for the first time, glances at Harry. But before either can speak...
DUMBLEDORE
And now, let us sing the school song! Everyone pick their favorite tune and off we go!
Professor McGonagall rolls her eyes slightly as Dumbledore wields his wand. Consulting the PARCHMENT of LYRICS placed beside their plates, Harry and his fellow First Years join a rousing, but rather dischordant, chorus of VOICES.
SCHOOL SINGING
Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts Teach us things worth knowing Bring back what we've forgot. Just do your best, we'll do the rest And learn until our brains all rot...
INT. MARBLE STAIRCASE - HOGWARTS - LATER - NIGHT
As the new Gryffindors follow Percy up the staircase, Harry stares in wonderment at the PORTRAITS on the walls: the people in them MOVE.
PERCY
This is the most direct path to the dormitory, except on Fridays, of course, when the staircases...change.
As the staircase before them moves to the right, Percy waits briefly, then leads on without comment to a...
INT. 7TH FLOOR CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
... a new corridor. Up ahead, Harry spies a bundle of WALKING STICKS floating in midair. Without warning, the walking sticks come flying forth. As the First Years duck and dodge, Percy sighs in annoyance.
PERCY
Gryffindors, I give you Peeves, Hogwarts resident poltergeist.
POP! A tiny translucent man with wicked eyes and wide mouth appears, clutching the last walking stick. He is PEEVES.
PEEVES
Oooh! Ickle Firsties! What fun!
With that, Peeves swoops off, wagging his tongue and bouncing a walking stick off Neville's head.
PERCY
walking on
Rather a nuisance, I'm afraid. Ah. Here we are.
At the very end of the corridor, hangs a PORTRAIT of a WOMAN in a pink silk dress. She looks at Percy.
PINK LADY
Password?
PERCY
Caput Draconis.
The portrait SWINGS FORWARD, revealing a ROUND HOLE in the wall. The students all scramble through it, into the...
INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - NIGHT
The students enter a cozy, round room, filled with squashy armchairs. At the top of a SPIRAL STAIRCASE, are two DOORS.
PERCY
Girls' dormitory to the left. Boys to the right. You'll find your belongings have already been brought up. Any questions?
no one speaks
Then, goodnight all. Oh, and don't forget. Before retiring, please place all living potion ingredients in your cupboards. This includes slugs, fire beetles and cutworms. Sweet dreams...
INT. BOYS TOWER DORMITORY - LATER - NIGHT
Moonlight falls through the tower windows as Ron, Neville arid Seamus slumber. As we find Harry, he is sleeping too, but it is not restful. He twitches and turns... there is a FLASH OF GREEN...then he awakens with a start, sits up. Trembling. He glances about the room, then lies slowly back. Eyes open.
INT. STAIRWAY - 12 NORTH - HOGWARTS - MORNING
The stairway bustles with students as Harry and Ron make their way. Clearly lost, Ron consults his TIMETABLE.
RON
This is Staircase Twelve North, which should take us to Backward Staircase Seven—no wait a minute, we're on Backward Staircase Seven...
HARRY
How many staircases are there?
HERMIONE
One hundred forty-two, though, in A History of Magic, Bathilda Bagshot makes unattributed reference to three others.
Harry arid Ron watch Hermione pass by, apparently holding every single First Year course book in her arms.
RON
I hate her.
INT. MCGONAGALL'S CLASSROOM - MORNING
Students sit attentively, looking front...at a CAT. Its markings, particularly around the eyes, are somehow familiar. Harry and Ron burst in, glance around.
RON
Whew! We made it, mate. Can you imagine old McGonagall's face if we were late first day out...
Hearing this, the cat narrows its eyes, leaps up and...TRANSFORMS...into old McGonagall herself. Ron's mouth drops open in amazement.
RON
That was bloody brilliant!
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. But perhaps it might be more useful if I transfigured Mr. Potter or yourself into a pocket watch. That way one of you might be on time.
HARRY
We got lost.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
Then perhaps a map. I trust you don't need one to find your seats?
Harry and Ron Slink past Hermione, sitting front row center.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
Transfiguration is some of the most complex, dangerous and valuable magic you will learn at Hogwarts. Use it skillfully and it may, one day, save your life. Make a mistake and you could find yourself with a toad's head and a monkey's tail.
opening a textbook
All right then. Shall we?
Harry and Ron exchange a glance, whip open their books.
INT. DUNGEONS - POTIONS - NEXT MORNING - DAY
As Professor Snape paces imperiously, Harry and the others sit in dead silence, eyes wandering to the PICKLED ANIMALS floating in GLASS JARS along the cold stone walls.
SNAPE
There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few...
glances at Malfoy
...who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you howto bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death. Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough to...not pay attention.
Harry blinks, realizes Snape is looking at him.
SNAPE
Mr. Potter. Our hew...celebrity. Tell me. What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?
Harry looks at a loss. Hermione’s hand shoots into the air.
SNAPE
You don't know. Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?
HARRY
I don't know, sir.
SNAPE
And the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?
Harry sees Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle sniggering.
HARRY
I don't know, sir.
SNAPE
Pity. Clearly fame isn't everything, is it, Mr. Potter.
HARRY
Clearly Hermione knows. It seems a pity not to ask her..
Neville, Seamus and a few other Gryffindors LAUGH.
SNAPE
Silence! And put your hand down, you silly girl!
Hermione wilts. Snape steps toward Harry, eyes glimmering.
SNAPE
For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is know as the Draught of the Living Dead. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite.
to the others
Well, why aren't you all copying this down?
The students scramble for their quills and parchment.
SNAPE
And Gryffindors. Note that five points will be taken from your House for your classmate's cheek.
INT. GREAT HALL - LATER - DAY
Harry stares glumly at the FOUR HOURGLASSES as the PRECIOUS GEMS drop in Gryffindor's, rise in Slytherin's. Down the table, Seamus is MUTTERING.
SEAMUS
Eye of rabbit, harp string hum...
HARRY
What’s Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?
RON
Turn it to rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday before it...
PFFFT! BLUE FLAMES shoot over the rim of the glass.
RON
Two Knuts says he loses his eyebrows by week's end. Ah, mail's here.
DOZENS OF OWLS circle the ceiling, then swoop down, dropping parcels from home. A copy of The Daily Prophet rolls onto the table near Harry.
RON
Hey look! Neville's gotten a Remembrall!
Neville holds a GLASS BALL filled with WHITE SMOKE. Slowly, the smoke begins to turn a DEEP SCARLET.
HERMIONE
I've read about those. If the smoke turns red it means you've forgotten something.
NEVILLE
Only problem is...I can't remember what I've forgotten.
Harry, Daily Prophet in hand, nudges Ron.
HARRY
Hey, Ron. Somebody broke into Gringotts! Listen: 'Believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowleging the breach, insist nothing was taken. The vault in question had, in fact, been emptied earlier that very same day.' That’s odd.
RON
It’s mad. Dad says there are dragons guarding some of the vaults.
HARRY
No. It’s just odd...That’s the day Hagrid and I were there.
EXT. THE GROUNDS - HOGWARTS - DAY
Harry stands in a cluster of Gryffindors, across from Malfoy and his Slytherin cronies. Between them, there is a LONG LINE OF BROOMSTICKS. MADAME HOOCH, a rangy witch with short grey hair and hawk-like eyes, stands between the two groups.
MADAME HOOCH
Welcome to your first Flying Lesson. Well, what are you all waiting for? Everyone step up to a broomstick. Come now. Hurry up.
Harry steps forward nervously, glances down. His broom is old, with twigs sticking out at odd angles.
MADAME HOOCH
Stick out your right hand, Over the broom, and say "Up"!
SHOUTS of "Up!" ring on the cold afternoon air. Though he barely WHISPERS the command, Harry’s broom SNAPS smartly into his hand. Hermione's simply rolls over. Ron's FLIES UP and CRACKS HIM IN THE NOSE.
MADAME HOOCH
Now. Once you’ve got hold of the broom, I want you to mount it. And grip it tight. We don't want you sliding off the end.
walking the row
Your other right hand, Mr. Finnegan. Goodness, boy, what have you done with your eyebrows?
SEAMUS
Lost 'em, ma'am.
MALFOY
Excuse me, Madam Hooch. Given that a few of us have been on sticks for years, would it not make sense to separate the expert flyers from...
glancing at Harry
...the neophytes?
MADAME HOOCH
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy, but I’m sure even an expert flyer such as yourself can appreciate the benefits of reacquainting oneself with the basics. Your grip, for example. It's thumb in, not out.
As Malfoy reddens, Harry and Ron share a grin.
MADAME HOOCH
Very well. Now when I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground. Hard. Keep your brooms steady, hover for a moment, then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On my whistle...Three...Two...
Jumping the gun entirely, a nervous Neville shoots straight up into the air, like a cork out of a bottle.
MADAME HOOCH
Mr. Longbottom! Exactly where do you think you're going?
Clutching desperately to his broom, Neville caroms crazily off a tree, flops upside down, rockets past the other students—who duck—then soars into a mad spiraling climb.
MADAME HOOCH
Come down here this instant!
Neville's pale face peers down, his eyes roll up...
MADAME HOOCH
On your broomstick, Longbottom!
Too late. With a giant THUD and a nasty CRACK, Neville hits the pitch. Madame Hooch and the Gryffindors rush over.
MADAME HOOCH
Broken wrist. Come on, dear. Up you get.
leading him off
Everyone's to keep their feet on the ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the Hospital Wing. Understand? If I see a single broom in the air, the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say 'Quidditch.'
As they go, Harry watches Neville's broom sail high over Hagrid's house, where the giant himself sits in the front garden, watching with a pair of BINOCULARS. Malfoy scoops Neville's Remembrall from the grass, cackles.
MALFOY
Did you see his face? Perhaps if the great lump had given this a squeeze, he would've remembered to fall on his fat arse.
HARRY
Give it here, Malfoy.
MALFOY
No, I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find. How about up a tree?
Malfoy slings a leg over his broom, KICKS into the air.
MALFOY
What's the matter, Potter? A bit beyond your reach?
Harry glowers up at Malfoy, then GRABS his broom.
HERMIONE
Harry! No! You heard what Madame Hooch said. Besides you don't even know how to...fly.
Harry shoots into the sky, so angry that it's a moment before he realizes what the others see clearly: he's a natural. Turning his broomstick sharply, he hovers, glaring at Malfoy.
HARRY
Give it here. Or I'll knock you off that ruddy broom.
MALFOY
Is that so?
Harry SHOOTS forth like a javelin, Malfoy just managing to slip his charge. As Harry whips around, Malfoy glances down at the ground, clearly unnerved. Harry simply smiles.
MALFOY
Have it your way, then!
Malfoy hurls the ball high. As it plummets, Harry throws himself into a steep dive, rocketing recklessly downward, ignoring the earth as it rushes toward him, extending his hand and...snatching the ball only feet from the ground. He lands running, grinning, as the Gryffindors cheer. then...
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
HAR-RY POT-TER!
Harry's stomach drops. Malfoy grins hideously.
MALFOY
Chin up, Potter. They might let you stay on as Hagrid's assistant.
INT. CORRIDOR - HOGWARTS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
Harry trails silently after Professor McGonagall.
INT. ADJOINING CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Professor McGonagall leans into an adjacent classroom.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
Excuse me, Professor Quirrell, could I borrow Wood for a moment.
Startled, Professor Quirrell jumps, then OLIVER WOOD, a burly fifth-year, emerges, glances curiously at Harry.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood...I've found you a Seeker.
INT. CORRIDOR - HOGWARTS - EVENING
Harry and Ron walk, buffeted by the stream of students heading for dinner. Hermione walks a few steps behind.
RON
Seeker! But first years never make the House teams. You must be the youngest Quidditch player in--
HARRY
--a century. According to McGonagall.
Just then, Fred and George descend.
FRED
Well done, Harry. Wood's just told us.
RON
Fred and George are on the team too. Beaters.
GEORGE
Our job to make sure you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises, of course. Rough game, Quidditch.
FRED
Brutal. But no one's died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally...
GEORGE
But they turn up in a month or two.
As the twins dash off, Ron reads Harry's troubled fade.
RON
Oh go on, Harry. Quidditch is great. Best game there is. And you'll be great too.
HARRY
But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?
HERMIONE
You won't make a fool of yourself.
Ron and Harry turn. They hadn't’even noticed Hermione.
HERMIONE
It's in your blood.
INT. TROPHY STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER
Hermione leads Harry and Ron to a DISPLAY CASE. Inside is a history of Quidditch at Hogwarts, with ancient brooms, strange equipment, and various TROPHIES. She points. Etched upon a SILVER TRAY, below a GRYFFINDOR LION, one NAME shines:
James Potter. Seeker.
RON
Harry...you didn't tell me your father was a Seeker too.
HARRY
I...didn't know.
INT. MARBLE STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER
As Harry and Ron trail Hermione up the staircase, Ron WHISPERS.
RON
I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do.
HARRY
Who doesn't?
Just then, the staircase LURCHES beneath their feet...
INT. FORBIDDEN CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
...and transports them to a very dark, very creepy corridor.
RON
Does anybody feel like...we shouldn't be here?
HERMIONE
We're not supposed to be here. This is the Third Floor. It's forbidden.
HARRY
intrigued
Why, though?
HERMIONE
Because Dumbledore said so. Let's go.
Meow. They freeze. A CAT sits watching them, eyes glittering in the dark. Then...a SHADOW scales the wall.
FILCH (O.S.)
Who goes there!
They turn, dash the opposite way. As they reach a DOOR, Harry grips the knob, twists. It's LOCKED.
FILCH (O.S.)
Lead me to them, my sweet....
RON
That's it. We're done for.
HERMIONE
Oh, move over. Alohomora!
Hermione gives her wand a swish and...the door swings open.
Harry and Ron stare incredulously.
HERMIONE
Standard Book of Spells. Chapter Seven.
INT. FORBIDDEN ROOM - CONTINUOUS
As they fall inside, Hermione presses her ear to the door.
RON
Chapter Seven?
HERMIONE
Shhh! Filch is...gone.
RON
He probably thinks this door is locked.
HERMIONE
It was locked.
HARRY
And for good reason...
Hermione and Ron turn. Standing a feet away is a DOG...only this one has three heads, three pairs of mad, rolling eyes, and three sets of hideous yellow fangs dripping with saliva.
As the dog ROARS, they tumble back outside and...
INT. 3RD FLOOR CORRIDOR
...Harry FLINGS home the DOOR just before the dog throws itself against it. They exchange a glance, dash off.
INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - NIGHT
The Pink Lady frowns as they spill through, stand gasping.
RON
What do they think they're doing keeping a thing like that locked up in school?
HERMIONE
You don't use yqur eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?
RON
I wasn't looking at its feet. I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice. There were three.
HERMIONE
It was standing on a trapdoor, which means-it's not there by accident. It's...
HARRY
Guarding something.
HERMIONE
That's right. Now, if you don't mind, I think I'll go to bed before either of you figures out another clever way to get us killed. Or worse...expelled.
EXT. PRACTICE FIELD - DUSK
Harry stands with Oliver Wood on the empty practice pitch.
WOOD
Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each team has seven players: Three Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper and the Seeker—that's you. There are three kinds of balls. This one's called the Quaffle.
holds up a red ball
The Chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of three hoops. The Keeper—that's me—defends the hoops. With me so far?
Harry nods, points to a WOOD CRATE rocking Violently.
HARRY
I think so. What's in there?
WOOD
Here. Take this.
Wood hands Harry a SMALL CLUB, kneels before the crate, and unlashes a leather strap. Instantly, a BLACK BALL rockets into the sky, then, without warning, PLUMMETS straight down— at Harry's head. Startled, Harry jumps aside and—purely on instinct—clubs it back into the sky.
WOOD
Not bad, Potter. You'd make a fair Beater. Careful now, it's coming back.
As the ball screams back to earth, Wood crates it.
HARRY
What was that?
WOOD
Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But you're a Seeker. The only ball I want you to worry about is...this.
Wood takes out a TINY BALL about the size of a walnut. BRIGHT GOLD, it has little, fluttering WINGS.
HARRY
I like this ball.
WOOD
You like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see.
HARRY
What do I do with it?
WOOD
Catch it. Before the other team's Seeker. You catch this, the game is over. You catch this, Potter...we win.
INT. PROFESSOR FLITWICK'S CLASS - DAY
PROFESSOR FLITWICK, a very tiny, gnome-like wizard, stands on a PILE OF BOOKS as he oversees the class.
PROFESSOR FLITWICK
Now don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been, practising. Swish and flick. Swish and flick.
Harry, paired with Seamus, poses his wand over the FEATHER before him and begins to swish and flick.
HARRY
Wingardium Leviosa.
The feather flutters, but never leaves the table.
PROFESSOR FLITWICK
And enunciate! Never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.
RON
WINGARDIUM LEVIOSA!
Ron windmills his arms grandly. Nothing. Hermione frowns.
HERMIONE
Honestly. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's Levi-ohhhh-sa. Not Levi-o-saaaah.
RON
You do it then, if you're so clever.
HERMIONE
Wingardium Leviosa.
Hermione swishes and flicks. Instantly the feather rises.
PROFESSOR FLITWICK
Oh, well done! Everyone see here. Miss Granger's done it!
PFFFT! Across the room, SMOKE curls between Seamus and Harry.
HARRY
I think we’re going to need another feather over here, Professor.
INT. COURTYARD - LATER - DAY
As Harry and Ron cross the courtyard, Ron mimics Hermione.
RON
It'sLevi-ohhhhh-sa. Not Levi-o-saaaah. She's a nightmare, honestly. No wonder she hasn't got any friends.
JuSt then, someone BUMPS into Harry. He turns, sees Hermione dash by, hugging her books, eyes glittering; with tears.
HARRY
I think she heard you.
INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT
Candlelit PUMPKINS flicker throughout the hall, while THOUSANDS OF LIVE BATS flutter overhead. Harry sits quietly, studying an EMPTY CHAIR, then sees Professor McGonagall standing across the way with Hagrid. Both are looking at him. McGonagall says something to Hagrid, who nods, then she steps away, approaches Harry.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
How are you, Potter? All right?
HARRY
Yes, Professor. Fine.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
I know...that is, we know...the members of the staff...that this is perhaps a difficult night for you. Halloween. Your parents...
Harry realizes what she is talking about. Nods.
HARRY
I'm all right, Professor.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
Very well.
She turnsstarts to go.
HARRY
Professor...Thank you.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
You're welcome, Potter.
As she goes, Harry sees Ron glumly pushing his food around, listening to Neville speak across the EMPTY CHAIR to Seamus.
NEVILLE
Parvati Patil said she wouldn't come out of the girls' bathroom. Said she's been in there all afternoon. Crying.
Just then, Professor Quirrell runs into the room, CRIES OUT:
QUIRRELL
TROLL IN THE DUNGEON! TROLL IN THE
DUNGEON ! Thought you ought to know...
He faints to the floor. There is a brief silence, then utter pandemonium breaks out; Students SHRIEK. Bats SCREECH.
POP! POP! POP! The hall goes still, all eyes on Dumbledore, standing at the front, purple smoke trailing from his wand.
DUMBLEDORE
Everyone will please not panic. Prefects, lead your Houses back to the dormitories. Teachers, follow me to the dungeons.
INT. MARBLE STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
As they follow Percy up the stairs, Ron still looks glum.
HARRY
How could a troll get in?
RON
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid. Probably Peeves' playing jokes...
seeing Harry's face
What?
HARRY
Hermione. She doesn't know.
INT. GIRL'S BATHROOM CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
Harry and Ron slip away from the Gryffindors, in with the Hufflepuffs, then down a deserted hallway. As FOOTSTEPS ring out, they duck behind a STONE GRIFFIN, see Snape hurry past.
HARRY
That's the third-floor he's going to. Teachers were supposed to go to the dungeons...
wrinkling his nose
What's that?
RON
Smells like Fred's socks. Only...worse.
Much worse. Lumbering toward them is a TROLL with an ENORMOUS CLUB. As it comes into a PATCH OF MOONLIGHT, it blinks stupidly, peers into a doorway, then slouches slowly inside.
Harry studies a SUIT OF ARMOR beside the door, thinks...
HARRY
Follow me.
Harry edges forward, pulls the SWORD from the suit of armor, and runs it through the door handle, trapping the troll.
RON
Yes!
Harry grins, then HEARS a high, petrified SCREAM.
HARRY
This wouldn't be the girl's bathroom, would it?
CUT TO:
CLOSE UP — HERMIONE SCREAMING
INT. GIRL’S BATHROOM - NIGHT
A HUGE SHADOW falls over Hermione’s face.
HERMIONE'S POV
...as the troll advances directly toward her.
She dashes into a stall, bolts the door. Trembling, she peers upw’ard.. .watching as...the troll's face appears over the top, looking in.
Panicked, she drops to the floor and shimmies into the next stall, out of Sight. Angered, the troll raises its club and—■ SMASH!--shatters the stall Hermione just vacated. As wood rains down in jagged, splintered pieces...
...Harry and Ron rush in, staring in horror as the troll raises the club high and SHATTERS the next stall.
Hermione, still crawling, covers her head and peers back.
SMASH! The club comes thundering down yet again, this time just inches from her foot.
RON
Don't worry, Hermione! We're here!
turning to Harry
She's dead.
HERMIONE
I heard that!
RON
What do we do?
HARRY
looking about frantically
Confuse it!
RON
Confuse it?
SHRUGGING
Hey, pea brain!
Harry and Ron grab anything they can arid begin to hurl it at the troll, but they might as well be throwing marshmallows.
As shards of wood bounce off its pint-sized head and great lumpy shoulders, the troll brings the club down once more and SHATTERS the last stall.
As Harry and Ron look on grimly, the troll jabs its club into the hash of wood before it, poking about for Hermione, when, at the last second...
...she scrambles out and dashes under the sink. GRUNTING furiously, the troll turns, begins to advance on her.
Harry, thinking fast, rushes forward and leaps upon the troll's rising club, rising himself...right out of FRAME...and then...dropping...
...right onto the troll's slimy neck. The troll blinks dimly and, before it can react, Harry—purely on instinct—shoves his wand straight up the troll's nose.
The troll ROARS in pain, dropping the club and stamping about. Ron watches helplessly, then glances at the club on the floor, an idea flickering across his face. Raising his wand, he SPEAKS:
RON
Wingardium Leviosa.
Harry swings around, sees Ron standing, wand poised. It does not inspire confidence. Ron looks at Hermione, takes a breath, and this time, employs the correct pronunciation.
RON
Wingardium LEVI-OHHHH-SA!
With that, the club quivers upon the floor...begins to rise. The troll, still raging, grabs Harry's leg and peels him off his body. As he holds Harry up high, suspended by one leg, Harry's world goes upside down, spinning, when...
...the club floats by his face. The troll pauses, watching in confusion as the club rises toward the ceiling, hanging in magical suspension until...
...THUNK! It drops smack on the troll's head. Wobbling, the troll releases its grip on Harry's leg and...
...drops him hard to the floor. Harry peers up. The troll wobbles one last time and starts to fall...directly on top of Harry. Quickly, Harry rolls away...
...just before the troll SLAMS to the floor, inches away.
All is quiet for a moment. Then Hermione steps forward.
HERMIONE
Is it--dead?
HARRY
I don't think so. Just knocked out.
RON
No need to kill it, after all.
HARRY
Yes, well, that was big of you. Ugh. Troll snot.
Harry extracts his wand, wipes it on the troll's trousers. A sudden VOLLEY of FOOTSTEPS announces the arrival of Professors McGonagall, Snape, and a still queasy Quirrell. Harry notices a SPOT OF BLOOD on Snape's leg, sees Snape shift his cloak to cover it.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
Explain yourselves! Both of you.
HERMIONE
It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
Miss Granger!
HERMIONE
I went looking for the troll. I've read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come along...I'd be dead.
Ron drops his wand, stunned by Hermione's lie.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
I'm very disappointed in you, Miss Granger. Five points will be taken from Gryffindor for your very serious lack of judgement. As for you gentlemen, I hope you realize just how lucky you are. Not many First Years could take on a full grown maintain troll and live to tell the tale. I award each of you five points...for sheer dumb luck.
INT. SEVENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
Hermione walks silently beside Harry and Ron.
HARRY
Good of her to get us out of trouble like that.
RON
Mind you, we did save her from a full grown mountain troll.
HARRY
Mind you, she might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the thing in with her.
Ron glances at Hermione, then away.
RON
What are friends for?
INT. GREAT HALL - DAY
Harry, Ron and Hermione sit together. Harry ignores his breakfast. Ron, as usual, is stuffing his face.
RON
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.
HERMIONE
Ron's right, Harry. You're going to need your strength today.
HARRY
I'm not hungry.
SNAPE
appearing
Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you. Even if it is against my boys.
Snape smiles, LIMPS away toward the Slytherin table.
HERMIONE
That was...disturbing.
RON
I tell you what's disturbing. Snape smiling.
HARRY
That explains the blood...
HERMIONE
Blood?
HARRY
Last night, Ron and I saw Snape heading for the third floor. I'm guessing he let the troll in as a diversion, tried to get past the three-headed dog, and got himself bit. That's why he's limping.
HERMIONE
But why would anyone go near that dog?
HARRY
Listen. The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. Said it was Hogwarts business. Very secret.
HERMIONE
So you're saying...
HARRY
That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.
RON
"But what's safer than Gringotts?
HARRY
One place, according to Hagrid. Hogwarts.
HERMIONE
Well, whatever it is, it must be really valuable.
HARRY
Or really dangerous.
Just then, an OWL beats into the room.
HERMIONE
Bit early for mail, isn't it?
HARRY
That's Hedwig.
All watch as she swoops down with a LONG, THIN PACKAGE. Harry slips Hedwig a piece of his uneaten toast, strips open the parcel and finds, inside, a sleek mahogany BROOMSTICK.
HARRY
It's a broomstick.
RON
That's not a broomstick, Harry. That's a Nimbus Two Thousand.
HARRY
But who...?
Harry glances up, sees—far across the room--Professor McGonagall looking his way. Quickly, she turns away.
EXT. QUIDDITCH FIELD - DAY
The stadium is full. Ron and Hermione join Neville and Seamus in the Gryffindor section, unfurl a banner that reads POTTER FOR PRESIDENT. As the Slytherin and Gryffindor teams take the field, the CROWD ROARS. Oliver Wood runs up alongside a nervous Harry, who clutches his new Nimbus 2000.
WOOD
I know what you're thinking, Harry. I'm playing my first game of Quidditch, the entire school's watching me and, worst of all, it's against Slytherin. Am I right?
HARRY
Pretty close.
WOOD
It's all right. I felt the same way before my first game.
HARRY
What happened?
WOOD
I don't really remember. I took a Bludger to the head about two minutes in and woke up in the hospital a week later.
Madame Hooch, clad in REFEREE ROBES, addresses the players.
MADAME HOOCH
Now, I want a nice clean game. From all of you.
She glances tellingly at Slytherin Captain MARCUS FLINT.
Harry leans over to ANGELINA JOHNSON, Gryffindor Chaser.
HARRY
Who's he, Angelina?
ANGELINA
Marcus Flint. Slytherin Captain. They say he's got troll blood in him.
Harry swallows as Flint glares at him murderously.
MADAME HOOCH
Mount your brooms, please.
Hands trembling, Harry waits, then the WHISTLE BLASTS. FOURTEEN BROOMSTICKS rise into the air. As the crowd ROARS, Madam Hooch kicks the crate, releasing two SCREAMING Bludgers, then tosses up the Quaffle. In the stands, LEE JORDAN does COMMENTARY.
LEE JORDAN
Quaffle's up...and straight off taken by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor. What an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive too, I might add.
Professor McGonagall casts a disapproving glance at Jordan, then turns to watch the action below.
Cradling the Quaffle, Angelina Johnson WEAVES wickedly past a Slytherin Chaser, DUCKS UNDER a sizzling Bludger that Fred Weasley CHIPS AWAY, then DISHES OFF to a speeding Alicia Spinnet. Alicia FALLS into a FIFTEEN FOOT ROLLING DIVE, feeds the Quaffle back to Angelina...but has it INTERCEPTED by a slashing Marcus Flint. Flint FLIES FAST for the hoop, rears back...but has his shot BLOCKED by Oliver Wood. Wood bumps, the Quaffle to Chaser Katie Bell, who ROCKETS past Flint the length of the field...only to take a Bludger to the back of the head. As the Quaffle pops loose, Marcus Flint grabs it, drives with astonishing speed back the other way, then takes a Bludger himself, courtesy of George Weasley. Angelina Johnson swoops down, Snatches the spinning Quaffle and, flying like lightning, races the field to score.
As Gryffindor CHEERS fill the cold air, Hagrid makes his way up the stands, scattering students in his wake.
HAGRID
Budge up there. Clear the way. How's Harry holdin' up?
Ron and Hermione squeeze together, giving Hagrid space.
RON
He hasn't had much to do yet.
HAGRID
First game. He stays outta trouble, that'll be doin' enough.
Above the pitch, Slytherin's ADRIAN PUCEY eludes two Bludgers, two Weasleys and the Chaser, ZOOMING toward the goals...when suddenly a FLASH OF GOLD zips by his left ear.
HARRY
The Snitch!
Far below, Slytherin Seeker TERENCE HIGGS makes his move.
Harry DIVES. Faster than Higgs, he closes the gap quickly, eyes locked on the tiny golden ball. He adds some speed, reaches out, and—WHAM!—Marcus Flint HITS HIM full on, sending him reeling. Harry PULLS UP his tip, LEVELS-OFF, and glances about. But the Snitch is GONE.
RON/HERMIONE/HAGRID
FOUL! FOUL! FOUL!
As a Bludger screams past Harry, he tries to kick his broom higher. Instead, it LURCHES, nearly tossing him off. Below, Hagrid peers through his BINOCULARS, frowns.
HAGRID
Dunno what Harry thinks he's doin'. If I didn't know better, I'd say he's lost control of his broom...
RON
Maybe something happened to it when Flint blocked him.
In the stands, people gasp as the broom ROLLS OVER and leaves Harry DANGLING from one end. Neville buries his face.
HAGRID
No. Can't nothin' interfere with a broomstick except, powerful Dark magic. No kid could do that to a Nimbus 2000.
Hearing this, Hermione GRABS Hagrid's binoculars.
HERMIONE
whispering to Ron
It's Snape. He's jinxing the broom.
Ron takes the binoculars, looks. Snape sits MUTTERING in the opposite stands, staring into the sky. Staring at Harry.
RON
Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
HERMIONE
Leave it to me.
As Hermione dashes off, Ron turns the binoculars back to the sky. Harry hangs from the broom with two hands while Fred hovers nearby. George circles about ten feet below.
HARRY
What’s George doing?
FRED
Just in case you fall, George will...
not sure of this himself
...catch you.
HARRY
I knew I should have gone out for football.
GEORGE
What's football?
Hermione fights her way through the Slytherin faithful, who cackle at Harry's plight, toward Snape.
MALFOY
Take a good look, lads. With any luck we'll be having Potter soup for supper—
Just then, Hermione brushes past, sending Malfoy ass over tea kettle into Professor Quirrell in the row below. Reaching Snape, Hermione crouches down and whips out her wand.
Across the field Ron peers through the binoculars...
RON
Come on, Hermione...
Just then, BLUE FLAMES spit from Hermione's wand, climbing quickly up Snape's robes. Snape continues to mutter, staring skyward, then realizes he's on fire, and looks away. In the commotion, that ensues, Ron sees Hermione scoop the blue fire into a little jar, slip it into robe, and make her escape.
Instantly, Harry's broom stops jerking. He clambers back on, when—SWOOSH!—A FLASH OF GOLD streaks by him: the Snitch. Higgs ZOOMS UP from below and he and Harry give chase.
The Snitch SWERVES, then... DIVES. As it PLUMMETS, Harry and Higgs plummet too, giving it all they've got.
On the pitch below, Hermione puts her hand to her mouth. In the stands, Neville buries his head again.
As the Snitch drops, the ground rushes crazily upward, the speed breathtaking. Harry seems intoxicated by it, slightly crazed, eyes riveted to the fluttering Snitch, seeing it and only it. Higgs, on the other hand, sees only the ground and, at the last minute, can bear it no longer, PULLING UP on his broom and SWERVING to safety. As Harry and earth collide, the Nimbus cartwheels away, Harry rolls off and, coming up on all fours, Claps his hand to his mouth. As if he were sick.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
Well, that's unfortunate. Understandable, but unfortunate.
As Harry COUGHS, Hagrid takes back his binoculars, which, unfortunately for Ron, are still around Ron's neck.
HAGRID
Unfortunate nothin'. He's got the Snitch!
Harry SHOOTS his hand in the air. The crowd ROARS. Marcus Flint touches down, fuming.
FLINT
He didn't catch it. He swallowed it!
HERMIONE
popping in
Nothing in the Quidditch rulebook discriminates against catching the Snitch in your mouth. Or any other place for that matter. In fact, in a game played in Greece in the late seventeenth century—
MADAME HOOCH
Thank you, Miss Granger. We can dispense with the more unattractive historical details of the game. Nevertheless, your point is well taken. Match to Gryffindor!
As Harry's teammates lift him to their shoulders, Hermione spies Snape in the far stands, limping quickly away, his robes still smoking.
EXT. HOGWARTS GROUNDS - LATER - DAY
Harry, Ron, and Hermione walk with Hagrid towards his home, a WOODEN HUT on the edge of the Dark Forest.
HAGRID
Rubbish! Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?
HARRY
Who knows? Why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween?
HAGRID
How do you know about Fluffy?
RON
Fluffy?
HERMIONE
That thing has a name?
HAGRID
'Course he's got a name. He's mine. Bought him off an Irish bloke I met in the Pub las' year. Lent him to Dumbledore to guard the...
HARRY
Yes?
HAGRID
Don' be askin' me anymore. That's top secret, that is.
HARRY
But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it.
HAGRID
Codswallop! Snape's a Hogwart's teacher.
HERMIONE
Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid. I've read all about them. You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking.
HAGRID
Now listen to me, all three of yeh—yer meddlin' in things that shouldn't be meddled. It's dangerous. What that dog's guardin' is strictly betw'n Professor Dumbledore and Nicolas Flamel—
Hagrid stops, furious with himself, then turns for his hut, where FANG, an enormous black boarhound, greets him.
HARRY
Nicolas Flamel. Why does that name sound familiar?
EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - DAY
December.. Snow falls, dusting the castle turrets and blanketing the grounds. Hagrid drags a GIANT CHRISTMAS FIR toward the Castle, Fang trotting by his side.
INT. GREAT HALL - DAY
Nearly Headless Nick SWOOPS about a TOWERING CHRISTMAS TREE, running GARLAND over the limbs, while Peeves plucks ORNAMENTS from the branches, hurling them to the floor.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
Listen up! As the lake is frozen, all students going home for holiday will take a flying sleigh to the departure platform. Earmuffs are strongly recommended.
Harry and Ron pay no attention to the students bustling about them, sitting alone by the window playing WIZARD CHESS. Unlike Muggle chess, these figures are alive. Presently, Harry's BISHOP looks cross.
BISHOP
Don't send me there! Can't you see his Knight? Send him. We can afford to lose him.
The bishop points to a PAWN. Harry sheepishly complies.
RON
Queen to pawn six.
Ron YAWNS as his queen steps forward and--with extreme prejudice—disposes of the pawn. Hermione, huge trunk in tow, arrives just in time to witness the carnage.
HERMIONE
Oh my god! That's barbaric!
RON
That's chess. I see you're packed.
HERMIONE
I see you're not.
RON
Change of plans. My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother Charlie. He's studying dragons there.
HERMIONE
You can help Harry then. He promised to keep looking in the library for Nicolas Flamel over holiday.
RON
We have looked. A hundred times.
HERMIONE
as she exits
Not in the Restricted Section.
RON
I think we've had a bad influence on her.
INT. BOYS TOWER DORMITORY - MORNING
CAMERA PANS a stack of PACKAGES at the foot of Harry's bed.
RON
Happy Christmas, Harry!
Harry rubs his eyes, sees Ron wearing a MAROON SWEATER over his pajamas. Ron tosses him a present.
HARRY
I've got presents.
RON
What'd you expect? In your hand's from Hagrid. And by the looks of that lumpy one, Mum's sent you a Weasley sweater.
Harry opens Hagrid's, finds a WOODEN FLUTE. As he blows it, Hedwig cocks her head. It sounds like an owl. Harry takes up the next parcel. It's very light. He reads the NOTE attached.
HARRY
'Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you.'
Harry tears the paper away, finds something SHINY and translucent slithers to the floor.
HARRY
It's some kind of...cloak.
RON
Well, let's see then. Put it on.
As Harry takes the cloth, we hang on Ron, watching, then:
RON
Ahhh!
Harry's head is floating in midair. Ron looks on in awe.
RON
Harry, do you know what this is? It’s an invisibility cloak. They're really rare. Who gave you this?
HARRY
There's no name...It just says, 'Use it well.'
INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT
Pitch black. A match STRIKES, floats by itself, in midair. It drifts forward, LIGHTS a LAMP.
INT. LIBRARY - ROW OF BOOKS - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
The lamp floats eerily among the books, then rises, illuminates a SIGN: RESTRICTED.
INT. RESTRICTED ROOM - LIBRARY - NIGHT
The lamp FLOATS into the room, the invisibility cloak drops and, bit by bit, HARRY appears.
HARRY
Flamel. Nicolas Flamel...
Harry runs his finger along the spines, stops. Takes a LARGE BOOK from the shelf. Runs his hand over the course leather, then...opens it. At once it begins to SHRIEK! Harry SLAMS it shut, but it goes on WAILING. Stumbling back, Harry tips the lamp and all GOES dark. FOOTSTEPS ring out. Frantically, Harry sifts the darkness for the cloak, panicking, when his hands...DISAPPEAR. Pitching the cloak over himself, he dashes to the door, just as it CLANGS open—revealing Filch. As Filch's pale, wide eyes stare straight ahead, Harry glides right past him...
INT. LIBRARY CORRIDOR - NIGHT
—then dashes into the corridor, the book’s SHRIEKS echoing behind him, coming face to face with... Snape and Quirrel, in the midst of a heated conversation.
SNAPE
Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid’s, yet?
QUIRRELL
B-b-but Severus, I—
SNAPE
You don’t want me as your enemy, Quirrel.
QUIRRELL
I don’t know what you—
SNAPE
You know perfectly well what I mean. Your little bit of hocus pocus...
Harry walks slowly, carefully around them, trying not to be heard. Snape stops, as if he's felt a small breeze, then... turns... seeing soft FEATHERS OF VAPOUR. Snape reaches out to touch them... Inside the cloak, Harry puts his hand to his mouth, to stop his breath... Snape finds nothing in front of him. He turns back to Quirrel.
SNAPE
We'll have another little chat soon, when you've had time to think things over and decide where your loyalties lie.
The door behind them slowly opens and closes... quietly, carefully...
Filch appears, from around the corridor, walks up to Snape and Quirrel.
FILCH
Professors... I found this. In the Restricted Section. It's still hot.
SNAPE
Then they can't be far.
Snape, Quirrel and Filch exit.
INT. EMPTY CLASSROOM - NIGHT
Harry drops the cloak, exhales, and absently rubs his scar; wincing mildly. As his eyes adjust, he sees a MAGNIFICENT MIRROR, as high as the ceiling, across the room. On the frame is an INSCRIPTION: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. He steps in front.
HARRY
Ah!
Harry turns—as if expecting to see someone--but finds only the dark shapes of desks and chairs.. Slowly, he turns back.
In the mirror, Harry sees his own startled reflection and...beyond...a MAN and a WOMAN.
HARRY
Mum? Dad?
INT. BOYS TOWER DORMITORY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
CLOSE UP: A SLEEPING RON
HARRY
Ron! Ron! Wake up!
Ron squints in confusion, then Harry lowers the cloak.
HARRY
There's something you've got to see!
INT. EMPTY CLASSROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER - NIGHT
Harry drags Ron to the mirror.
HARRY
Come look! It's my family.
RON
yawning
That's you, Harry.
HARRY
Look in properly, go on, stand here.
Harry steps aside. Ron takes his place and...freezes.
HARRY
There. You see them, don't you? That's—
RON
Me. Only I'm...Head Boy! And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup and...bloody hell...I'm Quidditch Captain too! Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?
HARRY
troubled
How can it? All my family are dead.
INT. GREAT HALL - THE NEXT MORNING - DAY
The Hall looks deserted as the students who remain eat breakfast. The Weasleys chatter amongst themselves, laughing, then Ron looks away, sees Harry staring into the distance.
RON
Want to play chess?
HARRY
No.
RON
Want to go visit Hagrid?
HARRY
No.
RON
Harry, I know what you're thinking. But don't. There's something not right about that mirror.
INT. EMPTY CLASSROOM - NIGHT
Harry sits before the mirror, transfixed.
DUMBLEDORE (O.S.)
Back again, Harry?
Harry turns. Dumbledore slips off a desk, sits beside him.
DUMBLEDORE
I see that you—like so many before you—have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I expect by now you realize what it does.
HARRY
It shows me my family.
DUMBLEDORE
And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.
Harry looks surprised. Dumbledore smiles.
DUMBLEDORE
I don't need a cloak to become invisible.
re: the mirror
I'll give you a clue, Harry. The happiest man on earth would look into the Mirror of Erised and see only himself, exactly as he is.
HARRY
So, then, it shows us what we want... Whatever we want...
DUMBLEDORE
Yes and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them gathered around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his family, sees himself standing alone. Remember this, though, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it. Even gone mad.
rising
That's why it will be moved to a new home tomorrow. I ask that you do not go looking for it again, Harry. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.
HARRY
Can I ask you something, Professor? What do you see when you look in the Mirror?
DUMBLEDORE
I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks. One can never have enough socks, Harry. You'll do well to remember that as well.
EXT. SCHOOLCOURTYARD - DAY
Bundled against thechill,Harry—burdened by heavy thoughts— enters the empty courtyard, Hedwig on his arm. As he releases her, she sails high over the castle walls...wending her way through the turrets and then out over the wintry grounds, her reflection glimmering on the surface of the icy lake below.
As she turns, beating her way back, the dark sky lightens, turning a slow, glorious blue and the once-dark trees shimmerin the crisp Spring light. Hogwarts itself shimmers as well, no longer dusted with snow. Hedwig glides over the castle walls, swoops, and comes to a fluttering rest outside one of the high windows of the Great Hall.
INT. GREAT HALL - DAY
Hermione—book in hand—quizzes Ron, who seems more interested in the pack of Chocolate Frogs in his hand.
HERMIONE
I'll ask you again. What are the three most Crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?
RON
And I'll tell you again. I forgot.
HERMIONE
And what, may I ask, do you plan to do should you get that question on final exams?
RON
Crib off you.
HERMIONE
You will not. Besides, according to Professor McGonagall, we're to be given special quills bewitched with an anti­ cheating spell.
RON
That's insulting. It's as if they don't trust us.
frowning
Dumbledore again.
As Ron tosses the wizard card onto the table, HARRY WATCHES IT SPIN...just.as...a smattering of LAUGHTER erupts across the hall. Neville is HOPPING like a bunny, legs STUCK TOGETHER, while Seamus trails after.
RON/HERMIONE
Leg-Locker Curse.
and then to each other
Malfoy.
Neville, breathing hard, reaches the Gryffindor table, then, before anyone can catch him, topples to the floor.
RON
You’ve got to start standing up to him, Neville.
NEVILLE
How? I can't stand up at all.
SEAMUS
I offered to do the countercurse, but he wouldn't let me.
NEVILLE
Of course not. That's all I need, you to set my bloody kneecaps on fire.
SEAMUS
I don't appreciate the insinuation, Longbottom. Besides, if anyone cares to notice, my eyebrows have completely grown back.
As Seamus turns away, the others see a curious BALD SPOT on the back of his head. Ron takes out his wand.
RON
All right then, Neville, who shall it be? Me, Hermione, or...
HARRY
I've found him.
Ron stops, sees Harry holding up Dumbledore's wizard card. Ron takes it.
RON
He's bowling. So what? He's always bowling.
Harry rolls his eyes, turns the card over for Ron to READ.
RON
'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood...and his work on alchemy...with his partner, Nicolas Flamel.'
HARRY
I knew the name sounded familiar. I read it on the train that day.
Hermione steps right over Neville.
HERMIONE
Follow me.
NEVILLE
Hey! Wait! What about that counter-curse!
Neville1 eyes shift. Seamus smiles, raises an eyebrow.
INT. LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
CLOSE UP: A BOOK ON ALCHEMY
as it hits the table with a LOUD THUD. Hermione flips through the pages as Harry and Ron look over her shoulder.
HERMIONE
How could I be so stupid! I checked this out weeks ago for a bit of light reading.
RON
This is light?
HERMIONE
Of course! Here it is!
whispers dramatically
Nicolas Flamel is the only known maker of the Sorcerer's Stone!
Harry and Ron glance at each other, then Hermione.
HARRY/RON
The what?
HERMIONE
Oh, honestly, don't you two read?
reading
’The Sorcerer's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will transform any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.'
RON
Immortal.
HERMIONE
It means you'll never die.
RON
I know what it means—
HERMIONE
’The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday.'
looking up
That's what Fluffy's guarding on the Third Floor. That's what's under the trapdoor. The Sorcerer's Stone!
HARRY
So Flamel knows someone's after the Stone...gives it to Dumbledore to keep safe at Hogwarts...not realizing that the one who's after it...
HERMIONE
Teaches at Hogwarts.
RON
So Snape wants piles of gold and to live forever. Who wouldn't?
Hermione closes the book, troubled by something.
HARRY
What is it, Hermione?
HERMIONE
I don't want to scare you, Harry. It's just...if all Snape wants is the Sorcerer's Stone...why did he try to kill you that day on the Quidditch pitch?
Harry ponders this, but doesn't have an answer.
EXT. HAGRID'S HUT - LATER - NIGHT
Harry, trailed by Ron and Hermione, KNOCKS on Hagrid's door.
The door rattles, opens a crack, and Hagrid peers out.
HAGRID
Oh. Hullo. Er...not ter be rude, but I'm not really fit ter entertain right about--
HARRY
We know about the Sorcerer's Stone.
INT. HAGRID'S HUT - NIGHT
Everything here is oversized. Hagrid adds wood to an already roaring fire, putters about a large, simmering kettle.
HAGRID
Snape! Blimey, yer not still on abou' him, are yeh?
HARRY
Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know...why.
HAGRID
Harry, Snape was one o' the teachers in on protectin' the Stone. He's not abou' ter steal it.
HARRY
What?
HAGRID
Yeh heard me: Snape was one o' the teachers in on protectin' the Stone. Now, as I said, I'm a bit preoccupied at the moment--
HARRY
Wait a minute. One of the teachers?
HERMIONE
Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments...
HAGRID
Tha's right. Bloody waste o' time if yeh ask me. T'ain't no one goin' ter get past Fluffy. Not a soul knows how 'cept me an' Dumbledore—
CRACK! A CLICKING SOUND is heard coming from the kettle, then a curious SCRAPING. Harry looks. Sees a HUGE BLACK EGG.
HARRY
Hagrid...exactly what is that?
HAGRID
Ah. Well. That's...er...
RON
I know what that is! But Hagrid. How did you ever get one?
HAGRID
Won it. Off a stranger in the village. Think he was glad ter be rid of it, ter be honest.Blimey...
The scraping is furious now. Quickly, Hagrid takes the egg from the kettle, sets it on a table. Fissures spread like veins over its surface, then it...EXPLODES... SHELL FLYING LIKE SHRAPNEL. Harry, Ron and Hermione cover themselves.
HERMIONE
Is that...a dragon?
RON
That's not just a dragon! That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.
HAGRID
Isn't he beautiful! Bless 'im, look, he knows 'is Mummy!
tickling the dragon's tummy
Hullo, Norbert.
HARRY
Norbert?
HAGRID
Well, he's got ter have a name.
The dragon blinks at Hagrid, screws up its face and...SNEEZES, spewing forth a shower of SPARKS, which sends Fang whimpering and kindles a brief blaze in Hagrid's beard.
HAGRID
Needs ter be trained up a bit, o' Course,
stopping cold
Hey, you there!
All turn. Peering through the window is a FACE.
HARRY
Malfoy!
They leap to the door--see a fleet figure racing across the grounds, disappearing in the night.
EXT. HOGWARTS GROUNDS - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
Harry, Ron and Hermione walk toward the glittering castle.
HARRY
Hagrid always wanted a dragon. Told me so the first time I ever met him.
RON
But it's crazy. And worse, Malfoy, knows.
HARRY
I don't understand. Is that bad?
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL (O.S.)
Mr. Potter. Mr. Weasley. Miss Granger.
Up ahead stands Professor McGonagall, a jagged silhouette in castle-light. Beside her, Draco Malfoy grins arrogantly.
RON
It's bad.
INT. PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL'S CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Harry, Ron and Hermione stand before a displeased McGonagall, while Malfoy looks on, practically quivering with pleasure.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
As every schoolchild knows, dragon­ breeding is against our laws, has been ever since the Warlock's Convention of 1709. And for good reason. It's hard to keep the Muggles from noticing us if we've got a thirty-foot Ukranian Ironbelly running around the back garden.
RON
Norwegian Ridgeback.
Professor Mcgonagall's eyes shift, narrow on Ron.
RON
I just meant... in this case...sorry.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
Personally, I don’t care if Hagrid has a Chinese Fireball sitting in his kitchen, Mr. Weasley. He answers to Dumbledore. You, on the other hand, answer to me. Nothing —I repeat, nothing--gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, fifty points will be taken.
As the others gasp, Malfoy's eyes glimmer with cruel ecstasy.
HARRY
Fifty?
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
Each. And to insure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention.
MALFOY
Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said the four of us.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
Indeed. You see, Mr. Malfoy, however noble your intentions, you too were out of bed after hours. You will join your classmates in detention.
INT. GREAT HALL - MORNING
As Harry, Ron and Hermione eat breakfast, the HOURGLASSES tell the tale: Gryffindor has slipped to last place. Just then, Fred and George pass by.
FRED
Don't worry, you three. This'll all blow over.
GEORGE
It may take a year or two, but eventually people will start talking to you again.
HERMIONE
sniffing defensively
Well, I for one, see nothing wrong with a reduced social life. It'll give us more time to revise for finals.
RON
Why bother? Even with Malfoy losing points, Slytherin's a lock for the House Cup. And look. Malfoy knows it.
All three peer at Malfoy. He raises a goblet in their direction, cackles with Crabbe and Goyle.
HERMIONE
He won't be smiling tonight,
off Harry and Ron's looks
Haven't you heard? For detention they're taking us into the Dark Forest.
EXT. HOGWARTS GROUNDS - NIGHT
Beneath a pale moon, Filch, carrying a lantern, leads Harry, Ron, Hermione and Malfoy across the dark grounds.
FILCH
A pity they let the old punishments die. Was a time, detention would find you all hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons...
EXT. HAGRID'S HUT -MOMENTS LATER
As Filch and the others reach the yard, they find Hagrid stringing a crossbow, Fang at his side.
FILCH
A sorry lot this, Hagrid. I pity you.
Filch squints, sees tears running down Hagrid's face.
FILCH
Good god, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?
HAGRID
to Harry, Ron, Hermione
Norbert's gone. Dumbledore's sent 'im off ter Romania ter live in a colony.
HERMIONE
Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind. Better all around, don't you think? Especially for Fang.
Hearing his name, a singed Fang beats his BANDAGED tail.
HAGRID
But what if Norbert doesn't like Romania. What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all.
RON
A baby that breaths fire.
Harry elbows Ron, silencing him.
FILCH
For god's sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the Forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you.
MALFOY
The Forest? But I thought that was just a joke. We can't go in the Forest. Students aren't allowed. And there's...werewolves.
FILCH
turning away
Oh, there's more'n werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure o' that.
EXT. DARK FOREST - LATER
Harry and the others trail Hagrid down a skinny path through the dark trees. Hagrid turns to Harry, speaks low.
HAGRID
Sorry abou’ this, Harry. Know it’s me that deserves punishin’, not you. By all rights I should be sittin’ in a cell in Azkaban tonight.
HARRY
It’s all right, Hagrid. Besides, it’s not your fault we were out after hours. If we hadn’t come knocking on your door in the middle of the night—
Abruptly Hagrid kneels, takes something onto his fingers.
HARRY
a bit warily
What’s that?
HAGRID
The reason we’re here.
rising
All righ’ now, lis’en up. See this here?
Hagrid holds up his fingers. They're marked with SILVER.
HAGRID
It's unicorn blood. I found one dead a few weeks back and two before that first term. This one here's been hurt bad by summat. It's our job to find the poor thing. Only one way ter get that done and that's ter split inter two parties. Ron, Hermione—yeh'll come with me. Harry, yeh'll go with Malfoy.
MALFOY
I want Fang then.
HAGRID
Fine. But jus', so yeh know. He's a bloody coward.
EXT. PATH - DARK FOREST
Fang trots down the path ahead of Harry, while a nervous Malfoy trails behind.
MALFOY
Wait until my father hears about this. This is servant stuff. We should be writing lines or...something.
HARRY
If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared.
MALFOY
You're too stupid to be scared, Potter, growing up with Muggles. If you were from a real wizard family, you wouldn't be laughing.
HARRY
I'm not, believe me...
As Malfoy joins Harry, he stops dead. The trees ahead are striped violently with DRIPPING SILVER, and beyond—lying in a small clearing—is the broken body of a UNICORN.
Fang backs off, something primal in his eyes. Harry watches Mm, reading hisfear, then..the SLITHERING SOUND returns. Seconds later, a HOODED FIGURE slithers over the leaves, drops its head over the leering WOUND on the unicorn's side...and begins to DRINK ITS BLOOD.
MALFOY
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Malfoy bolts, slipping and sliding as Fang whimpers after. Barry WINCES, clutches his scar, then sees that the Hooded Figure is staring directly at. him, silver dribbling down its front. Woozy from pain, Harry staggers back, then falls, the SLITHERING SOUND DRAWING CLOSER, when...
HOOVES pummel the path behind him and some thing leaps clear over him, flickering past the moon above. It charges the hooded figure, drives it back into the trees...and away.
A SHADOW FALLS across Harry's face. It is a CENTAUR with eyes like pale saphires. He is FIRENZE.
FIRENZE
Harry Potter. You are known to many creatures here. You must leave. The forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you.
HARRY
What was that thing you saved me from?
FIRENZE
Only one who has nothing to lose would commit such a crime. It is a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that-- from the moment the blood touches your lips-you will have a half life. A cursed life.
HARRY
But who would choose such a life?
FIRENZE
Can you think of no one?
HARRY
Do you mean to say that thing that killed the unicorn, that was drinking its blood, that was Voldemort!
FIRENZE
Do you know whatis hidden in the school at this very moment, Mr. Potter?
HARRY
The Sorcerer’s Stone.
AND FOR THE UK AUDIENCE...
HARRY
The Philosopher’s Stone...
A commotion is heard as Hagrid and the others come slashing through the trees. As Harry reacts, the others break into the clearing.
HERMIONE
Harry!
HAGRID
Oh, it’s you, is it, Firenze. I see you’ve met our Mr. Potter. All right there, Harry?
Harry nods...but he looks anything but all right.
INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - LATER
Harry paces before the fire while Ron and Hermione watch.
RON
You mean...You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest!
HARRY
But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself. He wants the Stone for Voldemort. With the Elixer of Life Voldemort will be strong again. He'll...come back.
RON
But if he comes back, you don't think he'd try to...kill you? Do you?
HARRY
I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight.
Ron looks vaguely sick.
RON
And to think I've been worrying about my Potions final.
HERMIONE
No. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?
as they turn
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore's around, you're safe, Harry. As long as Dumbledore's around...you can't be touched.
EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - DAY
Students flock onto the sunny grounds, finished with exams.
HERMIONE
I'd always heard Hogwarts' end of year exams were frightful. But I found that rather enjoyable. Weren’t you stunned not to be asked about Elfric the Eager?
RON
I'm stunned my head didn't explode. Alright there, Harry?
HARRY
My scar. Keeps...burning.
HERMIONE
It's happened before...
HARRY
Not like this...
Harry glances across the grounds at Hagrid, sitting in his front garden playing a FLUTE. At his feet, Fang's eyes droop.
HARRY
No...
HERMIONE
Harry?
Harry starts across the grounds. Hermione and Ron glance at one another, rush after.
HARRY
Don't you think it's a bit odd, that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon? And a stranger turns up who just happens to have one? I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pocket? Why didn't I see it before?
INT. HAGRID'S HUT - MOMENTS LATER
Hagrid shrugs, goes on polishing the FLUTE in his hand.
HAGRID
Ne'er saw his face. Kept his hood up.
HARRY
Didn't that strike you as unusual?
HAGRID
Yeh meet a lot o' unusual types in the village. Ain't 'xactly usual meself.
HARRY
This stranger, though. You and he must've talked...
HAGRID
He asked what I did, the sorta creatures I look after. Tol' him after Fluffy a dragon wouldbe easy.
HARRY
And did he seem interested in Fluffy?
HAGRID
Well, yeah. How many three-headed dogs do yeh meet, even if yeh're in the trade? So I tells 'im, this stranger, the trick with any beast is ter know what calms 'em. Take Fluffy, fer example. Jus' play 'im a bit o' music an' he'll go straight off ter sleep--
Hagrid stops, horrified by his slip.
HAGRID
I shouldn'ta tol' yeh that! Forget I said it! Hey! Where yeh goin'! Hey!
INT. MCGONAGALL'S CLASSROOM - DAY
Harry, Ron and Hermione clang through the door, Professor McGonagall looks up.
HARRY
We have to see Professor Dumbledore. Immediately.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
I see. Well, I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. Only moments ago, he received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off to London.
HARRY
He's gone? Now? But this is important! This is about...the Sorcerer's Stone.
Professor McGonagall nearly drops the books in her hands.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
How do you know--
HARRY
Someone's going to try and steal it.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
Nonsense. I don't know how you three found out about the Stone, but I assure you it is well protected. Now, run along.
EXT. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
Harry leads the others down the corridor.
HARRY
That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape. Which means he knows how to get past Fluffy.
HERMIONE
And with Dumbledore gone...
SNAPE (O.S.)
Good afternoon.
They freeze. Up ahead, Snape stands, studying them.
SNAPE
Now what would three fine Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on such a lovely day?
HERMIONE
We were just...
SNAPE
You want to be careful. People will think you're...up to something.
Snape eyes Harry, then turns away.
HERMIONE
What do we do now?
HARRY
Go through the trapdoor. Tonight.
INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - NIGHT
Empty. Dark. Two doors ease open. Hermione slips out the one, Harry and Ron the other. They creep toward the Pink Lady when--CROAK!--they freeze. Look. Breath a sigh of relief.
HARRY/RON/HERMIONE
Trevor.
Trevor the toad blinks up at them. CROAK!
RON
Trevor! Shh! Go! You shouldn't be here.
NEVILLE
Neither should you.
They all jump. Neville rises from an armchair.
NEVILLE
You're sneaking out again, aren't you?
HARRY
Now, Neville, listen...
NEVILLE
No! I won't let you. You'll get Gryffindor in trouble again. I'll...I'll fight you! You were the ones who told me I had to stand up to people!
RON
To people. Not us.
Neville raises his fists. Unfortunately, his teddy bear pyjamas somewhat undermine the intended effect.
HERMIONE
Neville. I'm really, really sorry about this.
raising her wand
Petrificus Totalus!
Instantly, Neville's arms and legs snap to his sides. He SWAYS...then FALLS FLAT...only his eyes moving, staring at them in horror. Harry and Ron look a little horrified too.
RON
You're a little scary sometimes, you know that? Brilliant. But scary.
INT. THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
CAMERA DRIFTS...down the corridor. Suddenly, up ahead, Peeves rounds the corner, MUMBLING to himself as he JUGGLES a trio of APPLES. Suddenly, he stops, eyes narrowing suspiciously.
PEEVES
Who's there? Know you're there, even if I can't see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?
Nothing. Peeves smiles slyly, reaches back, and hurls one of the apples. It streaks through the air...then...disappears in mid-flight. Peeves smile fades.
PEEVES
Never mind.
He backpedals frantically, turns, and swoops off the way he came. Seconds later, Harry drops the cloak, tosses the APPLE in his hand to Ron.
HERMIONE
That was close.
Harry steps to the chamber before them. Inside, the thrum of MUSIC can be heard. Slowly, Harry starts to ease open the door...when... CRUNCH! Hermione and Harry jump, turn. Ron stands chewing the apple.
RON
Sorry. I get hungry when I'm nervous.
Harry pushes the door clear...finds...a giant quivering nose and yellow fangs dripping with saliva. They GASP, then...
RON
Wait a minute. He's...
HARRY
Snoring.
Harry pushes the door further and the light from the corridor falls on a TINY HARP. Playing by itself.
INT. FORBIDDEN CORRIDOR - NIGHT
As they enter, Harry takes a FLUTE from his pocket.
HARRY
Suppose we won't be needing this now. Look, it's obvious Snape's already got past Fluffy. If you two want to go back—
RON
Don't be stupid.
HERMIONE
We're coming.
HARRY
Right then. All together now.
Straining mightily, they put their shoulders to the massive paw that lays across the trapdoor. Once done, Harry flings it open. Below lies only darkness...a faint whistling wind.
HARRY
I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign. If something...bad happens...get yourselves out—
stopping
Does it seem a bit...quiet...to you?
HERMIONE
The harp...what happened to the—
Splat! Something wet and sticky hits Ron's shoulder.
RON
Yuck! What's this ruddy stuff—
Slowly, they look up. A MONSTROUS, DROOLING SHADOW darkens their faces. Fluffy. Awake. Hungry. Each head ponders its own particular snack, then, with a mighty GROWL, swoops.
Instantly, the trio pitches themselves into the darkness...
INT. SHAFT/DEVIL'S SNARE - SECONDS LATER
Harry PLUMMETS down a glittering shaft, tumbling head over heels, down, down, down, until...
FLUMP! He lands in something soft and yamlike, followed quickly by Ron and Hermione. Harry adjusts his glasses, looks up. A tiny SQUARE OF LIGHT—the trapdoor—glimmers far above.
RON
That was...cool.
HARRY
We must be miles under the school.
RON
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.
HARRY
WO!
A vine snakes out Ron's back collar.
RON
Wo!
Twin creepers encircle Harry's chest.
HERMIONE
Stop moving! Both of you! This is Devil's Snare! You have to relax.
HARRY
Uh, Hermione, it's a bit difficult to relax...
as a vine encircles his neck
...given the circumstances.
HERMIONE
I know, Harry. But you must. If you don't, it'll only kill you faster.
RON
Kill us faster? Oh now I can relax.
As they watch, Hermione takes a LONG, SLOW BREATH and...is SUCKED beneath the surface...VANISHING.
HARRY/RON
Hermione!
Panicking, Harry and Ron begin to struggle anew, but the vines only wrap more tightly around them.
RON
What are we going to do now!
HERMIONE (O.S.)
Just relax.
HARRY
glancing about
Hermione? But how...where?
HERMIONE (O.S.)
Do what I say!
Harry looks at Ron. He's almost completely entwined.
HARRY
I suggest we do what she says.
Harry takes a DEEP BREATH and closes his eyes. Slowly, like witch's fingers...the vines DRAW him beneath the surface.
INT. STAIRCASE (BENEATH DEVIL'S SNARE)
Harry drops through the ceiling, twisting through the webby undergrowth of Devil's Share and onto the ground next to Hermione. From above, Ron can be HEARD screaming for HELP.
HERMIONE
He's not relaxing, is he?
Ron's VOICE BELLOWS again.
HARRY
Apparently not.
Hermione furrows her brow, thinking ALOUD in a sing-song.
HERMIONE
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare. Dances in the dark, delights in the damp...
INT. SHAFT/DEVIL'S SNARE
Ron, wrapped tight as a mummy by this point, cocks his ear in disbelief.
RON
Is she doing a poem? It's not possible she's doing a poem, is it?
INT. STAIRCASE (BENEATH DEVIL'S SNARE)
Hermione ignores him, continuing in deep concentration.
HERMIONE
It's deadly fun, but will...sulk in the sunl That's it! Light! Devil's Snare hates the light!
She whips out her wand, points it at the vines hanging from the ceiling, and sends forth a BRIGHT BURST of GOLD.
INT. SHAFT/DEVIL'S SNARE
As the LIGHT BURNS through, the plant withers. An OPENING forms, the vines SNAP free of Ron, and...he DROPS through.
INT. STAIRCASE (BENEATH DEVIL'S SNARE)
Ron lands heavily, looks up.
RON
Lucky we didn't panic.
HARRY
Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.
Just then...they detect a SOUND: a RUSTLING, a CLINKING. The three exchange a glance, begin to descend the staircase.
HERMIONE
What is that?
HARRY
I don't know...sounds like wings.
INT. CHAMBER OF KEYS
Harry, Hermione and Ron enter a brilliantly lit chamber where hundreds of JEWEL BRIGHT BIRDS flutter below a high arching ceiling. On the opposite side is a HEAVY WOODEN DOOR and, floating in the center of the chamber, a single BROOMSTICK.
Ron and Hermione begin to cross to the door, gazing in wonder at the strangely beautiful creatures overhead.
HERMIONE
Curious. I've never seen birds like these...
HARRY
They're not birds...
Ron and Hermione turn, see Harry standing by the floating broom in the center of the room, looking up.
HARRY
They're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door.
Hermione tests the doorknob, nods.
HERMIONE
Locked.
RON
Alohomora!
Hermione turns, sees Ron waving his wand at the knob. No good. It's still locked. He shrugs.
RON
Well, it was worth a try.
HERMIONE
peering up
Sowhat do we do? There must be a thousand keys up there...
RON
examining the lock
We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one—probably silver, like the handle. There! That one, see! With the bright blue wings!
Ron points. Fluttering within a pocket of brass keys is a larger, SILVER one.
HERMIONE
What's wrong with its wing?
RON.
The feather's pinched. Probably from Snape catching it before us.
Hermione nods, sees Harry still staring at the broom.
HERMIONE
Harry?
HARRY
It's...too simple.
RON
Oh, go on, Harry. If Snape could catch it on that old CleanSweep, you can. It's not for nothing you're the youngest Seeker in a Century.
Harry nods uncertainly—still troubled—but slowly reaches out nonetheless. As his fingers touch the broomstick...
...the KEYS EXPLODE IN A FRENZY, hissing like wasps, swarming in great, glittering clouds. Ron's smile droops.
RON
Well, this complicates things a bit.
As Harry kicks into the air, a seething cluster of keys falls like HARD RAIN, CHATTERING at his arms and legs, SLICING at his skin, SHREDDING his sweater...
RON
He'll be torn to pieces..
Horrified, Ron and Hermione watch Harry soar higher, fending off the keys with his free hand, until...
HARRY'S POV
Through a MAD CLATTERING, CLUSTER of KEYS, he spies the larger, silver one, fluttering only feet beyond his grasp.
Harry hovers, grimacing as the hissing keys drop like DARTS onto his extended hand...then SNATCHES the silver key.
Instantly, Harry whips downward in a wide, dizzying circle, trying to outrun the now furious keys. They shadow his every move, drawing closer and closer, HUMMING VICIOUSLY as they begin to CHIP at the TAIL TWIGS of the broom. Desperate, Harry throws the broom into a reckless dive and, steering with one hand...
...FLINGS the key to Ron. As Ron dashes to the door, Harry soars back up, taking the raging keys with him, then circles back and watches Ron JAM the key into the lock. As Hermione and Ron scurry through, Harry rockets straight after, the keys gaining once again, CHIPPING at the tail of broom like a buzzsaw through balsa wood. As the broom begins to WAFFLE, Harry gives one last BURST of SPEED and...SOARS through the open door. Together, Hermione and Ron FLING the door SHUT... just before the keys rain down like BULLETS.
INT. CHESS ROOM
...UTTER DARKNESS. Hermione's VOICE pierces the darkness.
HERMIONE
I don't like this. I don't like this at all.
A small bouquet of BLUE FLAMES blooms in Hermione's hands, illuminating little more than the trio's faces and some VAGUE SHAPES looming ahead.
HARRY
Where are we? A graveyard?
Harry steps forward and—suddenly--one of the SHAPES moves towards them. Hermione GASPS. The SHAPE stops.
RON
This is no graveyard...
Ron takes an unlit torch from the wall, touches it to the blue flames fluttering in Hermione's palms, and kneels. As he paints the floor with light, a SPARK SPITS from the torch and ignites a trail of FIRE.
RON
It's a chessboard.
Sure enough. As the chamber glows with light, a kind of battlefield is revealed, studded with faceless soldiers.
HERMIONE
But what're we to do?
As Hermione takes a tentative step onto the board, a BISHOP'S STONE SWORD drops heavily down, barring her way.
RON
It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play pur way across the room. Excuse me...are we meant to join you?
as the bishop nods
Brilliant.
to Harry, Hermione
Now don't be offended, but neither of you are particularly good at chess—
HARRY
Just tell us what to do.
RON
All right. Harry, you take the empty Bishop's square. Hermione—you'll be the Queenside castle. As for me...
Ron leaps astride the only riderless horse.
RON
...I'll be a Knight.
HERMIONE
What happens now?
RON
We play.
Across the board, a WHITE PAWN moves forward two squares (e4). As Ron contemplates his own move, Hermione glances apprehensively at the fierce pieces across the board.
HERMIONE
Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like real wizard's chess, do you?
Ron—contemplating something--doesn't answer immediately, instead gesturing to his own pawn.
RON
You there...d5
As Ron's BLACK PAWN obliges, WHITE'S PAWN slides swiftly forth (to d5) and, with a THUNDEROUS collision, the black pawn EXPLODES, rubble raining to the ground.
RON
Yes, Hermione? I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess.
DISSOLVE TO:
...the chess board, a real battlefield now, littered on both sides with fallen pieces. Ron, drained but intense, surveys the board, MUTTERING to himself.
RON
Think...Think.
deciding
Castle to ...c3
The BLACK CASTLE advances. Instantly, the WHITE QUEEN sweeps forward and, with cruel indifference, SHATTERS the Rook. Harry, only one square removed, stares with horror.
Unnerved, he glances up at Ron, but Ron's eyes see only the board. Harry turns, taking a look himself...and blinks.
HARRY
Wait a minute...
pointing to the Queen
She's made the same mistake I always make. If I go there, she has to take me, and the King is exposed!
Ron nods, but it's clear he doesn't share Harry's enthusiasm.
RON
There's just one problem with that. It's you that has to go on, Harry. I know it. Not me. Not Hermione. You.
HARRY
No, Ron...
HERMIONE
What is it?
HARRY
He's going to sacrifice himself.
HERMIONE
No. There has to be another way!
RON
Do you want to stop Snape from getting the Stone or not!
turning to Harry
You understand, right, Harry? Once I make my move, the Queen will take me. Then you're free to check the King.
Harry stares at Ron—an understanding between them—then simply nods. Ron grips the reins then and, without a word, drives his horse forward (Nh3). Instantly, the White Queen POUNCES. As Ron hits the floor, Hermione SCREAMS. She starts to go to him, when Harry holds up his hand.
HARRY
No!
AS SHE FREEZES
Don't forget we're still playing.
Hermione nods, staring at Ron. Harry steps forward (Bc5).
The WHITE QUEEN moves to block (Qe3), but it's futile.
Harry stares at her, eyes full of hatred, then steps forward, places his trembling hand on the cold stone of her gown and, with the gentlest of shoves...topples her.
HARRY
softly
Checkmate.
As a veil of dust hovers, the white king removes his CROWN, lets it roll from his fingers, across the stone floor, where it comes to rest at Harry's feet. Harry stares at Hermione's stricken face.
HARRY
If you can, go to the Owlery and send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right. I have to go on.
Hermione turns, her eyes glittering. Without warning, she rushes forward, embraces Harry.
HERMIONE
You're a great wizard, Harry Potter! You are, you know!
HARRY
a bit embarrassed
Not as good as you.
HERMIONE
Me! Books. And cleverness. There are more important things—friendship and bravery and—-oh, Harry, be careful!
She turns then, goes to Ron. Harry studies his two friends, then looks away. The remaining chessmen bow, parting the way to the next door. He steps forward.
INT. LAST CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
Alone, Harry makes his way through a corridor that drops down like a tunnel. Up ahead, a chamber glimmers.
INT. THE LAST CHAMBER - NIGHT
Harry descends a staircase. As the chamber below comes into view, he sees a FIGURE standing before the Mirror of Erised.
HARRY
You!
The figure turns. It is Professor Quirrell.
HARRY
No. It can’t be. Snape...
QUIRRELL
Mm, yes, he does seem the type, doesn't he? So useful Snape. Swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-poor st-stuttering Professor Quirrell?
HARRY
But that day, during the Quidditch match...Snape to kill me.
QUIRRELL
No, dear boy, I tried to kill you. And, trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would've succeeded. Even with Severus muttering his little countercurse.
HARRY
Snape was trying to save me?
QUIRRELL
Oh, don't misunderstand. He hates you, just as he hated your father when they were at Hogwarts together. But he never wanted you dead. Your father, after all, saved his life once, long ago.
Harry looks stunned. Quirrell looks amused.
QUIRRELL
Didn't know? Surprising, given how curious you are Potter. I knew you were a danger to me right off. Especially after Halloween.
HARRY
You let the Troll in.
Quirrell nods, examining the Mirror as he speaks:
QUIRRELL
Yes. I have a way with trolls. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While everyone else was running about the dungeons, he went straight to the Third Floor to head me off. That three­ headed dog didn't even manage to bite Snape's leg off properly. He, Of course, never trusted me again. Rarely left me alone,. But he doesn't understand. I am never alone. Never...
frowning
Now what does this mirror do? I see what I desire, I see myself holding the Stone. But how do I get it?
VOICE (O.S.)
Use the boy.
Harry glances about in horror as the DARK VOICE echoes. Quirrell turns, eyes Harry.
QUIRRELL
Come here, Potter.
Quirrell points to the mirror. As Harry steps in front, he sees himself, looking pale and scared. Then, slowly, his reflection SMILES, puts its hand in its pocket, and pulls out a BLOOD-RED STONE. Harry's own eyes widen—in a mixture of stunned disbelief and fear. Struggling to control his expression, he shuts his eyes briefly...as if making a wish...lets out a breath, and opens them once again. His reflection WINKS, returns the Stone to its pocket and, to Harry's amazement...
...it DROPS HEAVILY into his own: He's gotten the Stone.
QUIRRELL
studying him
What is it? What do you see?
HARRY
I...I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.I...I've won the House Cup.
VOICE (O.S.)
He lies.
QUIRRELL
Tell the truth! What do you see!
VOICE (O.S.)
Let me speak to him.
QUIRRELL
Master, you are not strong enough.
VOICE (O.S.)
I have strength enough...for this.
Quirrell reaches up, unfurls his turban. In the mirror, Harry watches a FACE appear...on the back of Quirrell's head.
HARRY
in a whisper
Voldemort.
VOLDEMORT
Harry Potter. We meet...again.
Petrified, Harry stares at the face. It is hideous, constantly changing, struggling to become whole.
VOLDEMORT
Yes. You see what I've become. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something that, conveniently enough...lies in your pocket.
Harry wheels, dashing toward the staircase.
VOLDEMORT
Stop him!
Coolly, Quirrell SNAPS his fingers and, just as Harry reaches the threshold, FLAMES SHOOT from the floor, barring his way.
VOLDEMORT
Don't be a fool, Harry. Why suffer a horrific death, when you can join me...and live.
HARRY
Never!
VOLDEMORT
Ah, bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry...would you like to see your mother and father again?
Harry stops, looks up. Quirrell steps aside, Voldemort's face sliding from the glass and revealing...Harry's parents.
VOLDEMORT
Together, we can bring them back. All I ask...is for something in return.
Slowly, almost involuntarily, Harry removes the Stone from his pocket.
VOLDEMORT
That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just...give me the Stone.
Harry studies his parents' faces, drifting to his mother's, when...we RACK FOCUS...and Voldemort's hideous face surfaces through her's...and she is gone.
HARRY
Liar!
Voldemort's eyes narrow.
VOLDEMORT
Kill him.
Instantly, Quirrell flies across the room, knocking Harry clean off his feet and the Stone tumbling from his grasp.
Quirrell drops, his hand closing on Harry's neck. Harry winces at the touch, face creased in pain, looking up into Quirrell's face, when....for the briefest of moments—it becomes Voldemort's. Harry gasps, struggling, when—to his amazement—Quirrell's own face returns, SCREAMING, releasing Harry and recoiling.
QUIRRELL
Wh-what is this magic?
Harry, breathing hard, follows Quirrell's gaze, stares in horror: Quirrell's fingers are slowly turning to dust.
VOLDEMORT
Fool! Get the Stone!
Harry rises, looks at Quirrell's withering fingers, then to his own hands, healthy and whole. As Quirrell starts to move, Harry, in the flash of a second...
...decides. He bolts forward, reaches up with both hands and...presses them to Quirrell's face.
Quirrell SCREAMS, but Harry holds tight, growing weaker as the face under his fingers begins to DISSOLVE until, finally, just when Harry looks ready to pass out...
Quirrell's face drops away.
Harry staggers back. Quirrell's body steps forward, blindly lurching towards Harry, and then...crumbles to dust. Harry stands still, just staring, then turns wearily, picks up the Stone, when...an APPARITION—bearing Voldemort's devilish face—SWOOPS up behind. Harry spins, watching in terror as...
WHOOSH!—in a VIOLENT RUSH—Voldemort returns to DUST and WHISTLES FORWARD, passing through Harry, blasting him back -- through the air and onto the stone floor. As the dust disappears, all is quiet once more, and we CUT TO:
WIDE SHOT
Of Harry. Lying on the floor. The Stone glimmering dully in his palm.
INT. HOGWARTS HOSPITAL WING - DAY
A PAINTING...of an INJURED SOLDIER lying in a HOSPITAL BED. A NURSE enters the frame, begins to tend to his dressings as...
Harry awakens in a hospital bed of his own. On the table next to him, TREATS are piled high, including a raft of open WIZARD CARDS. In one, Dumbledore beams down.
DUMBLEDORE
Good afternoon, Harry.
Harry squints, as if the card itself had spoken to him, then sees that the real Dumbledore is sitting on the windowsill. The great wizard slides off, gestures to the treats.
DUMBLEDORE
Tokens from your admirers.
HARRY
Admirers?
DUMBLEDORE
What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret—so naturally the whole school knows. Your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your chocolate frogs. Though one suspects Agrippa and Ptolemy still elude him.
HARRY
Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione--
DUMBLEDORE
Fine. Both of them. Madame Pomfrey has explicitly forbidden visitors. But I think—with the help of a certain cloak— they've managed to monitor your progress.
HARRY
But what happened to the—
DUMBLEDORE
Relax, dear boy. The Stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicolas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around.
HARRY
But then, Flamel...he'll die, won't he?
DUMBLEDORE
He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But, yes, he will die. To one as young as you, I'm sure it seems incredible. But to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.
HARRY
But to destroy such a remarkable thing...
DUMBLEDORE
Yes, yes. As much money and life as one could ever want—the two things most human beings would choose above all else. Unfortunately, humans do have a knack for choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.
HARRY
How is it I got the Stone, Sir? One minute I was stating in the mirror—
DUMBLEDORE
Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone—find it, but not use it— would be able to get it. One of my more brilliant ideas and, between you and me, that's saying something.
HARRY
Does that mean—with the Stone gone, that is—that Voldemort can never come back?
DUMBLEDORE
I'm afraid there are other ways for him to return. And when—if—he does, it will take someone willing to fight a losing battle to stop him again. Someone like your parents. Someone like you.
HARRY
troubled
Professor Dumbledore. Voldemort said...if I gave him the Stone, he could bring back my...family. Could he have, sir? Really?
DUMBLEDORE
Some people are like mirrors, Harry. They reflect our most desperate desires. We see what they want us to see. As painful as it surely was...you made the right choice.
Harry nods. Dumbledore studies him thoughtfully.
DUMBLEDORE
Do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to touch you, Harry? It's because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you. And that kind of act leaves a mark.
Harry reaches up to his scar.
DUMBLEDORE
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin. It is the very thing someone like Professor Quirrell—full of hatred and greed—cannot understand. Or bear to touch.
HARRY
What is it?
DUMBLEDORE
Love, Harry. Love.
Dumbledore looks away then, smiles at Harry's treats.
DUMBLEDORE
Ah! Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since then I'm afraid I've lost my liking for them. But I think I'll be safe with a nice toffee.
popping it
Alas! Ear wax!
INT. MARBLE STAIRCASE - NIGHT
As Harry limps down the staircase, he can hear the good cheer of those feasting beyond the doors of the Great Hall. Below, Hermione and Ron stand talking. Harry stops, simply studying them, then they turn, see him. Nothing is said for a moment.
All of them beyond words. Then Harry nods to Ron's-bruises.
HARRY
All right there, Ron?
RON
All right. You?
HARRY
All right. Hermione?
She smiles.
HERMIONE
Never better.
INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT
The roaring Hall is bedecked in GREEN AND SILVER—Slytherin colors—in honor of their winning the House Cup.
RON
D'you think Dumbledore meant for it all to happen? And for you to do it? Sending you your father's cloak and all?
HERMIONE
Well, if he did—I mean—that's terrible. You could have been killed. Come to think of it, I could've been killed...
HARRY
I think Dumbledore knows pretty much everything that goes on here. The only thing I don't understand is Snape...
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
Professor Snape, Potter.
Harry looks up, sees Professor McGonagall there.
HARRY
Yes, of course. I was only wondering. Is it true? Did he hate my father?
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
They were not compatible personalities, if that's what you mean. And then, of course, your father did something Severus could never forgive.
HARRY
What was that?
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
He saved his life.
Astonished, Harry glances at Snape sitting at the High Table.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
I suppose he felt it his obligation ...to look after you this year.
RON
Of course! And now that he's squared things, he can hate Harry in peace, right, Professor?
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
Hogwarts teachers do not hate their students, Mr. Weasley...
pointedly, as she exits
No matter how taxing they may be.
R0N
I think she's warming up to me.
At the High Table, Dumbledore rises and the Hall quiets.
DUMBLEDORE
Another year gone! Now as I understand it, the House Cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus: tn fourth place, Gryffindor, with 312.
Percy turns and glares at Ron.
RON
You'd think saving the bloody school from a Dark Lord would count for something.
DUMBLEDORE
In third place, Hufflepuff, with 352. In second, Ravenclaw, with 426. And in first place, with 472 points...Slytherin House.
The Slytherin table erupts. Draco Malfoy, banging his goblet, casts a smirk at Harry, Ron and Hermione.
DUMBLEDORE
Yes, well done, Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account. I have a few last minute points to award.
The hall goes very STILL. The Slytherin smiles FADE a bit.
DUMBLEDORE
First, to Miss Hermione Granger, for the cool use of intellect when others were in grave peril... fifty points.
As the Gryffindors cheer, Hermione looks overwhelmed.
DUMBLEDORE
Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years...fifty points..
PERCY
My youngest brother, you know!
DUMBLEDORE
Third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor House...sixty points.
The DIN is deafening as Hermione makes the calculations.
HERMIONE
Oh my goodness. We've tied Slytherin!
DUMBLEDORE
And finally...it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but even more to stand up to our friends. I therefore award 10 points to...Mr. Neville Longbottom.
As the room ROARS and the HOURGLASSES shift, a stunned Neville accepts wild slaps on the back.
DUMBLEDORE
Assuming my calculations are correct, I believe a change of decoration is in order.
umbledore CLAPS his hands and--instantly—the green and silver of Slytherin-become the scarlet and gold of Gryffindor. Neville, white with shock, disappears under a pile of people hugging him. Draco Malfoy, looks stunned and horrified. Snape, with a horrible, forced smile, shakes Professor McGonagall's hand, then catches Harry's eye, his hatred still evident, but not enough to mar the moment. Harry considers the cheering faces’ that surround him, alone in the eye of a happy huricane. For a moment, he is not part of them, just watching. Then his voice joins the others, his face saying it all...
This is a long way from the cupboard under the stairs.
EXT. HOGSMEADE STATION - NEXT DAY - DAY
The Hogwarts Express stands steaming, ready to depart. From the doorway, Ron calls to Harry, alone on the platform.
RON
Come on now, Harry.
Harry glances about once more, then starts for the train.
HAGRID
Didn' think yeh'd be leavin' without sayin' goodbye, didya?
Harry stops, smiles as Hagrid comes loping forward. Hagrid hands him a LEATHER-COVERED BOOK.
HAGRID
That there's fer you to open on the train. Which seems to be leavin', by the way.
Harry holds out his hand. Hagrid takes it, then pulls him into a rough hug.
HAGRID
Go on now. An' Harry? If tha' dolt of a cousin o' yers Dudley gives yeh any grief, yeh can always threaten ter give 'im a pair o' ears ter go with that tail of 'is.
HARRY
But Hagrid. We're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that.
HAGRID
I do...
a wink
But yer cousin don't.
INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY
Ron half-dozes against the window, while Hermione does some "light reading." Harry sits opposite them, studying Hagrid's gift curiously. Then he opens it. Inside, the pages are filled with WIZARD PHOTOGRAPHS. Smiling and. waving at Harry from every page are the faces he first saw in the Mirror of Erised. The faces of his mother and father.
As the train lurches forward, Hermione looks up.
HERMIONE
Feels strange, doesn' t it? To be going home.
Harry traces his finger over the smiling face of his mother, then looks up, following Hermione's gaze to the window.
HARRY
I'm not going home...Not really.
EXT. TRAIN - MOVING AWAY - SAME TIME
As Harry peers out, his face is calm. Peaceful. Hogwarts Castle glimmers in reflection on his window and we...
